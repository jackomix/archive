# of game ideas: 617
<br><br>
2021-08-29<br>
-game that generates a random silly app or game (can be either a game or "tool"). the goal is to literally go to a stranger and convince them to try to download the app as well. of course, you shouldn't be a dick, but you should try to basically sell the app to the stranger. and since the app is likely weird or even dumb, it adds challenge. you could also do this with friends assuming they don't know about the actual game, but then you can't really do it again. (sales)
<br><br>
2021-08-28<br>
-non-scrolling (room based) pixel-art "platformer" (you just walk you don't jump) game where you go about a regular day, going to work and such. except you have to spot anything that's just your imagination. the game has a story, the main character imagining an exciting life as they live their boring one. as you point out these things, the player learns more about the over all theme. and the very end has three endings depending on how much you noticed were from the character's imagination. the game, is a sad game. (cry)
<br><br>
2021-08-27<br>
-multiplayer game with the prank team, one to two players, and the players team, usually 1 but maybe in certain levels you can do two. the levels for the players are just basic physics-based puzzle levels. except, the prank team gets to add contraptions and gadgets to try to prank and mess around with the players. after the prank team finish playing with the room, or run out of time, then the players have to try to play the level. the players have to complete the level as fast as they can, so the prank team has to try to confuse them or just slow them down. each level (bonus points if generated) has an estimated timer for how long it'd take. that would be the gold medal, the silver and bronze medals are worse times. if the players can't beat the bronze time, then they lose. if they can beat the bronze time, then they win, but they'll naturally want to get the gold medal. so i guess that team can kind of decide if they feel like the won, lol. (prank)
<br><br>
2021-08-26<br>
-cute 3d low-poly rpg game where you play as a bug who has to save the world, aka a dirty dumpster. (bug)
<br><br>
2021-08-25<br>
-party game for online voice chats, where the group is given a question, topic, or just a general ice breaker to talk about for 1-2 minutes. except, one of the people are tasked with playing a game as they are in the conversation. this makes it difficult for them to focus on both the conversation and the game, because if they lose the game, they'll be exposed prematurely. after the timer is up, everyone discusses and votes on who they think was the secret gamer (idk about the name, lol). every game has like, 3-5 rounds and the person with the most points wins. (too fast)
<br><br>
2021-08-24<br>
-game where you are the tech guy, like the tech guy in the vans in spy movies. the game uses voice commands, as you look over the spy, tell him what to do, and warn him of any threats as you try to help him reach the goal in the level. bonus points if you make this a multiplayer game where one player is the tech guy and the other is the spy, but that's also like a seperate game idea. (moving)
<br><br>
2021-08-23<br>
-game where the screen is divided into two parts vertically. the bottom is a bunch of sliders you drag with your mouse, that controls a hand as it moves around in its world. each level is an everyday action, and as the hand moves by itself, you have to control the rotation and fingers of the hand. i guess a bonus idea is to have the ability to record your mouse sliding one slider, and then in the end you'll have like 5 mouses at once controlling different sliders and stuff. but that kind of turns it into a different game, but whatever, two ideas in one day i guess, lol. (hand)
<br><br>
2021-08-22<br>
-fps stealth game where you try to sneak into places to steal stuff. the game is very physics based. you open doors manually, you can do stuff like break and pour out vases. you can interact with machines and move them. the game makes these very small interactible things that might usually just be one button in other games. but when they all come together, they feel weirdly realistic, but also can provide clever solutions when they all work together. like making those doors traps, so when a guard opens the door, something on top of the door will fall on them. the game can also have a level editor and a workshop if on steam too, and maybe mod support for more objects and mobs. you can also distract guards and go in disguises from citizens also. the game is in a low-poly art style. (stealing)
<br><br>
2021-08-21<br>
-simple site where you are given three comic panels that you can draw on, with a random panel in one of the panels. then you just fill in the blanks. at the start of the site it can use panels that were drawn by the site creator, but eventually it'd just use panels that other people drew. and once you're done you can save it and/or publish it. the panel that is already there can just have a blue border or something. (context)
<br><br>
2021-08-20<br>
-clicker game like cookie clicker. except the different buttons are placed in a first-person 3d room. the things you buy are robot parts, which you can use to make robots that push buttons. you can also buy buttons to get more stuff, but with catches, like moving around and whatnot. you can buy sensors, contraptions to make arms and legs, etc. there's no inventory, you just grab and place items. so you can also buy chests (and to open you'd have to drag the lid up, just for fun) and shelves to put the places in. you can also buy prints or label guns to make labels, which you can also use to name the robots. lol. i think this game would be very unique and i think would be really cool, and could be pretty successful. (automatic)
<br><br>
2021-08-19<br>
-game similar to blaseball, but just more boring i guess. marble races with different teams and players. the game plays on its own, simulating seasons with each player having their own stats, like size, density, gravity, material, softness, buoyancy, etc. players can bet on games with (only) virtual coins, and can buy tickets to encourage their favourite team to do something. like try to have the marbles be smaller, or heavier, etc. each game has different courses, that could be randomly generated per season but switched through each game. you can see the marble runs do their thing, with each marble visualizing their stats. for example, their size being the size of the marble and stuff. the game could just simulate using some physics engine. i feel like this game wouldn't be competition to blaseball, as i feel they're pretty different. but they would probably compliment each other nicely, i could see the two games having crossover events or whatever. it'd be cool if it even happened in the ui. :eyes: (balls)
<br><br>
2021-08-18<br>
-game where you have a book about different fictional drugs, including different side effects. you are a police officer who pulls people (probably taking place in some weird quirky planet so it'd be cartoony aliens) over and checks if they are under the influence of any of the drugs. you can talk to them and ask them to do certain tests. once you arrest someone and drive them to the police station, you'll see if you were right or not. the game is sort of open-world, there's no menu or specific levels. just you get money if you do the right job, and don't if you do something wrong. the only menu really would just be the main menu, the focus of this game is kind of immersion. i think it could be a cool and unique game, and could be different enough to where i'd want to play it more. (cocaine)
<br><br>
2021-08-17<br>
-game like tamagotchi, except it's more fast paced. the creatures' graphics are randomly generated, which can also depend on certain factors. these factors are actually very important. because once it grows up to be an adult, it'll live it's own life as you take care of other pets. and what's cool is you can check up on the status of your older pets. and those pets, depending on their interests and their personality stats, how they're doing and etc, can affect your life as well. (didn't mean to sound so dramatic, lol.) for example, if they become a chef, you might see their meals in shops that you can buy from. or if your pet is really good at business, you might notice the prices of things going higher or lower. your pet might even become a pet-carer as well, doing the same job as you. it'd basically be tamagotchi, but with 100x more simulation stuff. lol (born)
<br><br>
2021-08-16<br>
-game where you try to take down pc scammers. while you can follow with the scammers, of course being scammed afterwards, you can also try different ways to hack and get into their systems. then, you can see their files, camera feeds, etc. the goal of the game is to basically hack them and take down the scammers, jim browning style. (cyberpunk)
<br><br>
2021-08-15<br>
-game where you are shown two randomly generated monsters/gods/warriors/heros/whatever with randomly generated gear and stuff. you bet on which one you think will win. then, since each randomly generated being has a whole bunch of stats, the game simulates and shows the battle and what happens. almost being like an intense sports game. eventually, one of them win, and you either get more or less points. if you run out of points, you have to wait 2 days to get back the default points. and during those two days, you can't play the game. (maybe if you made it a little more like blaseball but still graphical then this could be a super fun and unique game to play.) (else)
<br><br>
2021-08-14<br>
-game like an eye test. the game tells you to sit a certain distance away from the screen. (or to be at the distance to where some object on the screen is the size of something idk, just to be more accurate.) then, different things will be very much in the distance, slowly getting closer to you. the goal is for you to type what it is, with you getting more points if it's further away. it starts with just objects, but then gets to actual eye tests and sentences. then there's distractions, like being in the middle of a busy city where people walk by you and such, with the objects still in the distance coming at you. bonus points if in the final level you can look around like an fps, and you have to look for the object coming close to you as people try to talk to you. it'd be the ultimate eye test, lol. i'd see it being one of those games where people just say to play it, and don't give an explaination to not spoil it for you. this would be a fun browser game i think as well. (far ahead)
<br><br>
2021-08-13<br>
-game like surgeon simulator but you fly a airplane for an airport. (bonus idea, you could add weird vr support by having the hand controllers almost feel like it's dragging the hand in-game. kind of like an elastic is attached between the player's actual hand and their hand in-game. you know what i mean?) (wing)
<br><br>
2021-08-12<br>
-3d fps physics game that takes place in a movie studio (so there's multiple sets like construction site or sitcom indoors or whatever) where you have to try to open a jar of jam. you pick up stuff like in source games. the game is a little bit sandbox-y, and each "level" is just different types of jars, including big torus jars with the lid in the walls of the hole area, etc. the game encourages you to problem-solve similar to how teardown does. (jam)
<br><br>
2021-08-11<br>
-game where you put your face to the screen and watch different animations. with the goal to not flinch. i guess you could test this by having the player grab their mouse and slightly hover it, so if they flinch they'd probably move their mouse a bit. it'd be cool to have some leaderboard (or even a "last person who played this game performed like blah" which would actually be a pretty cool thing, i don't think i've seen that done before) but it'd be pretty easy to lie or cheat. (close)
<br><br>
2021-08-10<br>
-game that's styled like a gameshow. it picks a random text from a random contact, and gives you four people that message could be from. you have to pick the answer that is right. the questions alternate between messages from them and message you sent to them. in the settings, you can disable and enable certain contacts if you don't want certain people to be picked. (inb4 this game is made and five-thousand "phone game cheating exposed compilation" videos pop up.) (phone)
<br><br>
2021-08-09<br>
-game like mario bros 1. you have 60 seconds before the game ends. you have to get a high score. when you beat a level, you get another 60 seconds. these levels however are randomly generated. many pipes allow you to go into them to go into another level. the levels generated have wacky and weird colours, so the vibe of the whole game is this weird lsd-like mario rom hack like game. when you do things that give you a score, like getting a coin or killing enemies or breaking blocks or whatever, they'll give you a small tiny bit of time (depending on the action) to help you continue. the game also tracks your time, so maybe that can be your score you focus on. the game then kind of feels like tetris, where some people just try to test their endurance, and some people try to get a higher score number. i'd really like to see this game, i think it'd be very unique, weird, and fun. and probably memorable too. just prey you don't get a dmca strike, lol. (mario)
<br><br>
2021-08-08<br>
-game where you hear a randomly-picked note, and have to type in the box (that has autocomplete so you don't have to worry about fully remembering) a song name where either the verse or chorus start with that note. then the game checks (by checking its midi) to see if you are right. while usually people don't have perfect pitch, you might be able to sing a note, and then remember a song that starts with that note and continue on from it. when the game picks a note, if you play multiple times it'll try not to give you repeats from at least 2-3 games ago, so you might be able to have "fake-perfect-pitch" by always attaching a song to each note. bonus points if you add video game music, since those are almost all instrumental and very memorable. (808)
<br><br>
2021-08-07<br>
-text adventure game about a game of baseball. how would a text adventure game work in the middle of a baseball match? that's why it's bizzare. (bizzare)
<br><br>
2021-08-06<br>
-short visual novel game with multiple endings where you try to break up with someone with a good ending of being friends. bonus points if you use ai to make it a text-based input instead of dialogue trees. (love)
<br><br>
2021-08-05<br>
-fps game where you are an employeer in an office job. you have to do several tasks. however, an evil spirit took partial control of your mind, and will kill anyone on sight. because of this, you have to make sure you don't look at any other employers. this includes if they try to talk to you. (looking is basically if your crosshair looks at their face.) (look)
<br><br>
2021-08-04<br>
-game where you have to solve as much captcha as you can. each captcha has their own timer, which makes you lose if it runs out. when you beat a captcha the timer resets, but gets faster as your score gets higher. and the captchas get harder. the types of captchas can vary for variety and fun chaos. (L)
<br><br>
2021-08-03<br>
-game where different companies reach out to your to draw and display a billboard for them. each company is basically just a new level. you have to draw and add text to the billboard. then, it'll be displayed on a highway (or in different locations based on the company), you'll see cars pass by and stuff. then the game measures how effective it was. how good it looked, how eye-catching it was, and how well the advertising was. and maybe on some random moments, or maybe when you (which is very rare) max out a stat, that an accident will happen because of it. like eye-catching causing cars to hit each other and stuff. it'd just be fun and interesting. the billboards can both looks silly and also actually really good, both work and let the player have fun. :) (billboard)
<br><br>
2021-08-02<br>
-jackbox party like game where each person takes a turn drawing a face according to a weird description. stuff like, "complusive liar", or "really loves dogs". you can only draw the face, and have to draw someone that looks like they would match the vibe/tone/energy of the term. then, the rest of the people are given the picture and 4 different options, including the correct one. the scoring would just be for any typical pictionary-style game. (younger)
<br><br>
2021-08-01<br>
-simulation game about high school. you can work on various stats that affect your reputation with different groups in the school. there's also events and special days that you can take advantage of, like prom or theatre, etc. you can also get relationships and make new friends and stuff. bonus points if it's kariosoft style. ;) (august)
<br><br>
2021-07-31<br>
-game where you are a plant that has to move around in the forest to get sunlight. this is because the trees above move and block the view in certain areas. you have to move to the sunlight to keep your health up, while avoiding the poisonous plants that stay or even move, depending on the enemy. (solar)
<br><br>
2021-07-30<br>
-vr futuristic game where you have hover-skates. the skating is fast and about dodging things and a little bit of parkour. you can also go on walls, basically changing the gravity only for you. there's a sandbox mode where you can just do tricks in the skate park. but there's also levels, sorted in categories of their difficulties, like marble blast. in the level, get to the end as fast as you can. this game would be fun to speedrun each level, like marble blast. (australia)
<br><br>
2021-07-29<br>
-2d top-down game about a time traveller who sees the state of a village in ruins, and has to go back in time to stop it. there is a digital clock in the top right of the screen with the time moving. you can talk to people and interact with them, interact with stuff, grab and use stuff, etc. the game uses many systems, as well as time based ones. for example, kids may get out of school at a certain time, or someone might be sitting at a tree thinking of ideas for their new book, and think of one and run back to their home to write it. everybody talks about what they feel at that moment, which makes it feel cool when you connect the dots. like "oh they said they were blah, so that makes sense that they're doing this now." with these real-time events, the game is pretty unique as you can basically make some examples of the butterfly effect. of course, with the overall goal to stop the secret antaginost (or maybe just an unlucky series of events) from burning down the village. and since the game goes on a timer, there'll be very intense and suspensful moments that'll make you feel like the hero in a movie. (alt)
<br><br>
2021-07-28<br>
-fps game where you wake up in your bedroom. you have to look around and check if you're dreaming by seeing if things are off. if you realize it's a dream you go back to bed to sleep and wake up, and check again. if you believe you are dreaming then you walk out your bedroom. before the stage (which is basically a different bedroom) starts you can check the bedroom and how it actually is. if you go to sleep when you were actually awake you'll be late for your meeting and you'll lose. if you go out when you are dreaming, you'll also be late since you're taking too much time, and the game will do some really super eerie thing when you go out, something similar to the hypnospace outlaw page with the cards and the email and the tentacles thing. (dream)
<br><br>
2021-07-27<br>
-game across a football field where two baseball batters stand on each side. one throws the ball up and bats it into the air, it'll fall down and the other batter has to hit it as well or they'll lose. the game is third person, and has a ball cam (so you see it go up, but also at an angle to where you can see your player as you run and stuff). (baseball)
<br><br>
2021-07-26<br>
-game that is weirdly realistic like The Long Drive (which I actually just found out is also a roadtrip game lol) that's multiplayer. the game is fps and you and 3 other friends go on a roadtrip. the game is also like the oregon trail though however, where as you drive, events start to begin to happen and whatnot. because of this, the game would provide a pretty unique experience where you really feel the distance (you don't just skip to the next turn or whatever, since you drive the whole way), and these events (that would feel natural happening it wouldn't be at once) would make the roadtrip feel like an adventure, since these memorable plot points happen. players might also get bored (one player has to also drive the vehicle), which is why when you stop at towns or whatever, you can grab random stuff like board games, video games, toys, books, etc. i think this game could actually work super well in vr. and over all i'd actually love to see this game be made. i think it'd be a super unique experience. if you're reading this and you're able to, make this game!!! (roadtrip)
<br><br>
2021-07-25<br>
-2d game where you have 60 seconds in a top down section in a random city to grab as much materials as you can. so you might grab metal from cabinents in buildings (since you can go in buildings), or grass, whatever. then after, you have to pick what materials certain components will be for a product. then with each material having their own characteristics (incluing crazy and wacky alien ones at the end of the game) you get to see how the product performs in a fun and cool and neato simulation test of the product that's 3d low-poly (think low-poly 3d ds graphics). maybe each material has a cost in mass production so have you to have a balance of quality and cost? but that sounds like it's just limiting and annoying and not fun and not encouraging the player to try wacky and fun mixes. though i don't know how else progression could be made. maybe a score on how well the product did, and earn money based off that? maybe the game takes place in different stages, and you have to play many games in that stage with any products you choose to get money to buy to pass that stage into the new one. (cheap)
<br><br>
2021-07-24<br>
-top down 2d shooter about a business man who flies through space doing deals with gangster aliens. (expensive)
<br><br>
2021-07-23<br>
-game where the goal is to close the program. the game is always on top so you're forced to beat it (though on launch it lets you know so you're not surprised). the game does stuff like trying to close task manager (by moving over to its close button and playing some animation), it'll try to cover your whole browser if you're trying to search. and it basically just does a whole bunch of stuff to try to stop you. with animations and stuff so it feels more like a game and less like a virus, lol. the solution to close it, i haven't thought of. but it'd probably be cool if it was a mix of an external and internal solution. btw SuperF4 is a program that the game could combat. as well as cmd. just giving techniques that the game could block. it'd also probably be cool if the game had some like personality or something, like a bratty kid or whatever. (get up)
<br><br>
2021-07-22<br>
-game where the camera focuses on a music box. the music box is one of those ones you put paper with the dots with through. the music box plays the notes from bottom to top to give you a reference. but then, it's similar to guitar hero, but instead of hitting a button for a note, you sing it. just a staccato (i originally spelled that as sticatoo lol) note. harder levels have more keys and/or more notes. (music)
<br><br>
2021-07-21<br>
-mobile game where you are a soccer player that starts at one side of the yard. you have to run and dodge the players that try to stop and steal your ball, so you can kind of like deek them out. then, at the end of the yard, you have to aims and shoot at the goal, going past the goalie. (ball or soccer i forgot the word i used lol (ok i think i might've actually used mobile))
<br><br>
2021-07-20<br>
-top down 3d chibi style game that takes place in different hotel rooms (basically the different levels. it's just one room for each level.) the goal for the kid is to make a mess, and the goal for the maid is to clean it. the controls are fast and party-game like. at the end of the minute, the person who did the most (most cleaned or most messy) in the room wins. (maid)
<br><br>
2021-07-19<br>
-game that could use gpt-3 or github copilot for the code generation, but basically each level is a windows 98/95 like screen with the windows. you have to do something, but can't do it because of blah. you have a pencil, and can draw buttons, fill in sliders, draw new windows, cursors, etc. these then come to life, and can actually perform what they are supposed to do. for example, the first level could be a window that says "close me!" but can't be closed because the x button is greyed out. so you can just draw a button on the window that says "close", and then click it to close. (gui)
<br><br>
2021-07-18<br>
-game where you are a parkouring bear that has to make it from one stage to another. the game is fps and is hard to make it through as you are big and heavy. you also have to avoid bear traps and collect any food you see along the way before you beat the level. (bear)
<br><br>
2021-07-17<br>
-first person game where you are in a very big and nicely design city at night. you start off at your house, and are given a list of max, 4 locations to go to. you don't know where these are but have stuff like maps (not dynamic, just on paper), street names, etc. you walk a dog through the relaxing city with relaxing sound design, including the chance for it to rain. the game is low poly but still artistic. i'm thinking the colour pink for this game, or more specifically #ffadb4 for some reason. this would probably be kind of the colour scheme with the dark but relaxing street. maybe stuff like the rain puddle reflections, moon light and the sky could be a nice blue, or more specifically #3363ff. though i do have f.lux on at 35% rn with the standard range, so the colours were a bit more warm for me. (vibes)
<br><br>
2021-07-16<br>
-you know that thing where you can't put earth on a 2d flat surface without distorting it? there's also a picture showcasing that with a head, showing how distorted it can be. the game would showcase that same effect. you'd be tasked with drawing different things on a 2d plane, and try to account for it being into the 3d shape it is. for example, you have to draw a 2d projection of a head, and after it puts it on a head model to see how you were. i feel like this game would be pretty unique (also hard to explain lol), and could also be pretty funny. (2d)
<br><br>
2021-07-15<br>
-vr game where one hand is the tongue and the other is the bottom jaw. you move your hands to control. each level has you trying to eat different foods while staying safe. (5 gum)
<br><br>
2021-07-14<br>
-tony hawk like skating game where you skate on different and weird objects like office chairs or cars on your feet or basketballs or whatever. (chair)

-desktop program where everyday it opens up with a new word. this is so everyday you learn a new word. then, you record yourself saying that word. eventually, you'll have a collection of you saying random words, which you can use in the "text-to-speech" part which just plays the words you type. it'd probably suck but it could be interesting. you could also have a calender mode with a list of all the words you learned, their recording, and the date you learned them. you could also have a mode where, maybe you record you reading the definitions too, and then a random one of those is picked and you have to guess what word the definition is talkinga about. idk, i feel like this could be really weird but fun and interesting. (mic)

-game where you are the lights manager for a play. you control the spotlight. the game is really short and is probably just a free short game. you move the spotlight and try to do a good job moving it to the main characters talking. at the end you get a percentage showing how accurate/good you were. (owl)

-game with a one screen level and a video-style slider bar at the bottom. you are the time police who have to stomp on and stop a time traveller. the slider goes to different time periods of this one-screen level, which both you and the time-traveller can move between. bonus points if you make a local multiplayer version where each player has to stomp on the other without being stomped themselves. i guess maybe the time traveller is destryoing time crystal found in the different time periods, so you have to stop them before they break all of them. it also gives you an idea of where they might be. for example, if there's only one time crystal left, you'd know where the time traveller is gonna go. (time)

2021-07-10<br>
-3rd person 3d game (kind of like mario 64) where the main character has a numchuck made out of a pair of shoes tied together with their laces. you can use this as a weapon against enemies, but also the main character can go into the shoes as it's being thrown to throw themselves into a certain direction. so you can go onto a high-up area, or launch across a long gap. i guess you could just like, press a button while your joystick aims where you want to go. (shoe)
<br><br>
2021-07-09<br>
-fps game that looks like TABS with ragdoll physics. you are in a decently big world with a farm. you have to get in your pickup truck and drive to the animal farm to transport different animals inside of your pickup truck. and since it's ragdoll it'll be funny cause it'll be funny to try to get the animals in there and they might fall out and stuff, it'd be funny. (sheep)
<br><br>
2021-07-08<br>
-2d game. there is a crowd of people which you can hold the right mouse button on to stop talking. the crowd is not just a line it's 2d. the talking people make is directional. there is a monster that makes monster noises, and you have to shut up people to see who it is. however, if you try shutting up the monster (who's blending in), you'll lose because it'll bite you (you shut people up with your hand covering their mouth or closing their jaw/mouth). you can also left click to shoot your gun, which is your final guess of who you think the monster is. the goal is to use audio and shutting up people to try to kill the monster. you have two minutes to decide before the monster acts out on the people. this game actually sounds pretty fun and would be definitely intense at the end. (shut up)
<br><br>
2021-07-07<br>
-game where you a space trader. you buy goods and try to sell them for profit, another main thing is trading. you have several tools like tools to check if a mineral is real, or history books to confirm if a contraption is real and goes with the history, etc. if you fail to detect these things, you'll lose a lot of money for buying expensive fake stuff and only being able to sell them for low. however, some stuff like the blackmarket allow you to try to make fake things yourself, to try to fool other buyers. that part is just a feature though, more like a semi-main mechanic. (diamonds)

-roguelite in space with mini planets and asteroids. jump across them to travel. get to the wormholes to go to the next galaxy (aka the higher level) and defeat the black hole boss. (stars)
<br><br>
2021-07-05<br>
-2d stardew-valley-like-top-down pixel art game where you are a detective. each level is a different crime scene with different evidence you can find and examine. then, once you think you know what happened (regardless if you found all the evidence or not), you then pick who you think the suspect was out of the suspects. then, the game goes back to the crime scene when the crime was actually happening, and you play as the suspect. you play as the suspect, and try to do everything you thought happened that would go with the evidence. this means you can have some strategy and mystery, but also action since you'd have to play what you think the criminal did. (case)
<br><br>
2021-07-04<br>
-game where you combine different chemicals to make different fireworks. you can play around with the fireworks but also do a mode that's similar to angry birds. (fireworks)
<br><br>
2021-07-03<br>
-game using gpt tech to make a salesman simulator. you are presented with randomly generated products, and have to go up to people and talk to them, then try to convince them to buy your product. this game would be i think really fun to play, and very unique of course. (guy)
<br><br>
2021-07-02<br>
-fps game where you have a health bar. the level has lots of platforms so you can jump around. the game is two player. if you look at the other player (with the left mouse button down but you'll just always have it) then they lose health, even if they are just on your screen. you can halve the rate of their damage if they're like half of their body is on the screen. 16:9, assuming that's the most popular screen ratio, would be the standard, and would use letterboxing for other screen ratios. (actually made from a joke my friend made)
<br><br>
2021-07-01<br>
-simple at first 2d game where you control the character left and right at the bottom of the screen as white blocks fall down. you have to dodge those blocks. as the game continues though, you go faster and faster. the graphics start improving, even going 2.5d, different music plays leading up to heavy electronic music, and you go at incredible speeds, making it a little hard to control to convey that fast feeling. the game is fun because it feels cool to go really fast, and the game aims to give you that "really really fast" feeling. of course, if you hit one of the obstacles, everything falls apart, and the music slows down like a tape machine, and you lose. (speed)
<br><br>
2021-06-30<br>
-cute rpg about a rat that has to go through a wacky and colourful sewer adventure to get back to the surface. (actually I think that's like what undertale is, but I never played it so lol) (sewer)
<br><br>
2021-06-29<br>
-game where you work with your friends to spike a volleyball high enough into the sun. (summer)
<br><br>
2021-06-28<br>
-qwop style of game but for the joints of fingers, hands and wrists. the goal is to do different sign language without taking too long or messing up too much. (five)
<br><br>
2021-06-27<br>
-vr game similar to surgeon simulator where you use a knife to try to shave the chocolate off of different chocolate bars, without damaging the bar. (cause not every chocolate bar is just solid chocolate.) at the end, it gives you a grade based on how clean it was. (kitkat)
<br><br>
2021-06-26<br>
-game where you play as a tv show host. this game would be way better in vr, but you have to read the teleprompter as you do stuff. the game use voice recongition software to hear how you're doing. from easy stages like news reports, to hard stages like cooking as you read and talk. at the end of each stage, you can watch how you were, and the game even has fake cameramen, so when you watch it, it changes camera angles. you could also bundle this with the script to make the cameras feel really real, since it is scripted after all. (presents)
<br><br>
2021-06-25<br>
-third person cute game where you play as a bear in the park. you have to scare off people and eat their picnic food. other bears are trying to do the same thing though, so you have to get picnic food fast, and swipe at bears so they might drop some food. (maybe the bears could be holding a basket in their mouth that collects the food, that'd be cute.) (bear)
<br><br>
2021-06-24<br>
-lemmings type of game, but the goal is to build a catapult to throw into the other side of the level to destory a building. the goal is to destroy the building. (vikings)
<br><br>
2021-06-23<br>
-web browsergame with different songs that pick a random speed to play. you can turn a knob to speed it up or slow it down slightly. submit your answer of what you think the real rate is and see how close you were to getting the original rate right. then, just move onto the next song. (slow)
<br><br>
2021-06-22<br>
-game similar to that "what do you think is more popular on google" game. you are presented with a song, artist or album (you would probably get to pick what categories you want), and you have to rate what your thoughts are on it, and then what you think the total rating is. it'd probably use rateyourmusic for this. then, you submit it. it shows you what the rating really is, which determines if you win (probably if you're close you'll stay). it also has a feature though that tells you how many users had near the same opinion as you, and how many of them got the other question right. the goal is to be on your longest score streak. (taste)
<br><br>
2021-06-21<br>
-first person game where you can interact and grab stuff with the mouse button (similar to portal's grab feature). you can plug stuff in this way. the goal is to try to make the closest electric guitar distorted sound you can by using objects that aren't electric guitars. so you plug them in the amp and do stuff. then once you submit it shows how close you are (probably using some math to check the similarity between the two sounds). i'd actually think this would be better if you didn't submit it, but like on the wall behind the amp it would just show the current score and highest score. i guess the score could be a percentage like 100.00%? (amp)
<br><br>
2021-06-20<br>
-phone game. you sign up, and have your own qr code. the goal of the game is to convince people to also join the game, and scan your qr code for you to increase a point. there would be a global (and maybe national) leaderboards showing the top players. i could imagine people going up to people asking if they wanted to try the game. or maybe even meetups of those players to help each other out. i think the game would be a really fun experiment. (volunteer)
<br><br>
2021-06-19<br>
-mirrors edge but you can throw hammers at buildings and break them like teardown. stages where you get from point a to b as fast as possible, and each stage is pretty replayable in of itself. (window)
<br><br>
2021-06-18<br>
-more of a game mechanic, but a top down car game where you can drift. when you drift, fire shoots out of your tires due to the friction. you can use this to attack enemies that are after you. maybe cars chase you around the city, and you have to survive as long as you can or collect spawning collectables? and then you can attack the enemies? idk. (burnout)
<br><br>
2021-06-17<br>
-bomberman, but the players are spiders on spiderwebs. the bombs can blow up the connection or string it's on. (web)
<br><br>
2021-06-16<br>
-vr game like fruit ninja. except you have paddles. you have to keep the fruit up in the air by bouncing them up in the air. when you click them, they split into two. the more fruit you have bouncing at the same time the more points you get as you play. the game ends when all your fruit are gone. (blade)
<br><br>
2021-06-15<br>
-vr game that takes place in a lab with a whole bunch of random stuff that you can do satisfying things like ASMR and other stuff. (headphones)
<br><br>
2021-06-14<br>
-3d third person game like qwop but you run down those fashion show runways. the clothes get sillier and sillier as you progress. the goal is to make it to the end of the show. (sexy)
<br><br>
2021-06-13<br>
-you know that game where you press the button when you think it's been a minute? the ultimate version of that. click when you think it's been 1 second, then 10 seconds, then 30 seconds, then a minute. then it shows the graph of time and when you hit the buttons vs what the times actually were. the game would be a webpage. (ratio)
<br><br>
2021-06-12<br>
-game where there is a ecosystem with animals. you must work on the first generation of your own animal for it to evolve. it's kind of like plague except you can only customize it at the beginning it it's evolution. as it evolves and accomplishes tasks you get points which you can use for other upgrades. the simulation is top down simple graphics (probably vector-based) so you can see the animals and the simulation. it also has a time speed changer. the goal of course is to make the superior animal, and as you take over ecosystems, you unlock bigger and harder ones with more biomes, animals, etc. in the end there could even be "thinking" upgrades which use neural networks for giving logic to animals, which other animals can also have. the other animals also evolve with yours. there might be stuff like one upgrade and another upgrade after multiple generations fuse or go into effect or whatever. it would be cool to be strategic and/or mess around. there would also be a sandbox mode for fun. (also maybe steam workshop support?) (animal)
<br><br>
2021-06-11<br>
-relaxing game where you are in a city. everyday you have randomly generated tasks to do. you go do them. as you progress, you get money and can buy upgrades. you also can do side-quests to get more rewards. the game is simple vector art style, top down 2d. upgrades include stuff like cars. there's also lots of fun and silly cheat codes. :) (friday)
<br><br>
2021-06-10<br>
-game that uses gpt-j (;]) where you interview a celebrity. then after the interview, you have to write a headline about the interview to try to get as much clicks on that article as possible. you could be sincere, or take things out of context just for clicks. (interview)
<br><br>
2021-06-09<br>
-you know that little game that used to be popular on youtube, where when you talked a pc would play your voice in your headphones with a delay, making you stutter? game with an audience where you try to debate with someone else, while both people have that. the game would be chaotic fun as people have difficulties talking. (duet)
<br><br>
2021-06-08<br>
-game where you are a home renovator for ants. it's similar to that animal crossing game about designing houses. you design houses for ants in their tunnels, caves, boots, etc. idk if the game would have a cute style. maybe like a realistic but cute as well style? so not just like a doodle artstyle? idk. the game would have a small story and i could see it being like on the front page of itch.io for a bit/while. (boot)
<br><br>
2021-06-07<br>
-platformer game where you have that paddle with ball on string toy. you can't jump, as your only method of going up is using the toy. it's also how to you hit enemies and such. (paddle ball)
<br><br>
2021-06-06<br>
-visual novel detective game where the culprit of a horrible murder is someone the main character loves. the visual novel would have have great storytelling to really make you feel like you're at a crossroad. the game would have two endings, both bittersweet (relating to jailing or not the culprit). (detective)
<br><br>
2021-06-05<br>
-3d skateboarding game (like tony hawk) but it's like tron where you make a trail. the trail is just deadly graffiti (lol) on the ground, so it doesn't go up. this would have typical skateboard gamemodes but also modes where you battle against bots and friends to try to get them knocked out. maybe that should just be the focus since there's other (and probably better lol) alternatives for just a regular skateboarding game. the game would have a similar art style to that popular cel-shaded skate game that people want a sequel of or something I forgot what it's called. (ok the game is focused on rollerskates but whatever, the game is jet set radio.) (honk)
<br><br>
2021-06-04<br>
-2d one-screen paltformer game where there are enemies coming in from the sides. you have to dodge them (or could be more fun if they were like goombas and you could jump on them) while the top tells you what to do. so for example if it says go left, then when it's small timer goes down (which is to a beat) it checks if you're going left. down could make you crouch and fall down faster. so you'd have stuff like the directions, jumping, falling, maybe bouncing (would have leeway so it's not frame-perfect lol), ducking, etc. bop it with your controls while you dodge and bounce of enemies. (the enemy behavior could be like goombas for a type of enemy, and the next type of enemy as the game gets harder would be like bullet bills) (bop it)
<br><br>
2021-06-03<br>
-top down 2d dodgeball. except instead of grabbing and throwing the ball, someone runs into it so it starts bouncing. each player then has a paddle they control that can go 360 degrees around them. so you would bounce the ball with your paddle into your opponents, and defend yourself by blocking the ball with your paddle. the game would be fast paced and could get intense with some good players. could just have "cpu or friends mode" but online would be cool too. the game would be pixel art. (cream pie)
<br><br>
2021-06-02<br>
-experiment where there's this really fun arcade game (you the dev decide what it is), but in order to play it you must work for 10 minutes. then you can play the game for 10 or 20 or 30 minutes max (you the dev decide the time) and after that you have to work again. the work is basically a fake work simulator where you do boring work. the experiment is to see if the reward of doing the work will make the game fun, or if it will make it boring, or anticlimactic, etc. (work)
<br><br>
2021-06-01<br>
-3d third person racing game (in a city) where instead of drivers maintaining and racing their car, superheros maintain and race with their capes/wings/etc. (superhero)
<br><br>
2021-05-31<br>
-game similar to telephone. someone is asked to draw text their answer of a question in black marker. then it's passed to the next person, who draws with red marker marking it, also writing what they did wrong. then it passes to the next person with a blue marker doing the same thing to what the red marker and (maybe idk) black marker did as well and it goes on until it's the ultimate marked paper. (highlight)
<br><br>
2021-05-30<br>
-game where you watch a timelapse of art being drawn, however, there's a point where the artist keeps and keeps drawing, eventually ruining it. you have to say when to stop. idk how this would be judged. maybe make it a party game and have everyone try the same timelapse, and then rank each others picks? have the artist pick a spot which they were actually done and compare how close they were to that spot when the player said stop? idk. (done)
<br><br>
2021-05-29<br>
-pachinko but ragdolls. (fall)
<br><br>
2021-05-28<br>
-site that picks 10 random words from the dictionary and puts them as buttons. anyone that goes on the site will see the same buttons as anyone else. they can pick a word and it'll be added to the text. basically overtime people will have contributed to make a long story or whatever. adds some rules like no spamming. the game would also keep track of stats, like when words were added (could have a cool graph that has each word's x position depending on what time it was.), how many words there are, etc. could be called "1/10 word game" (one outta ten word game) like the "one word story" game. (essay)
<br><br>
2021-05-27<br>
-online browser game where you go around a forest and pick out plants. the goal is to find 5 plants that are edible, by looking at the plants up close and looking for the details to indicate different things. this game would be for educational purposes probably from some university or company. i was thinking the game would be cute top down with pop ups for looking at plants but idk if that'd be cooler than some other thing. i guess vr would be good but it'd ruin a bit of the "education" part since not everyone would be able to play. (mushroom)
<br><br>
2021-05-26<br>
-game like katamari, except you start with a ball and roll it in the house to put stuff in the house (so like reverse katamari), then at the end it shows the house with the furniture where it is and scores based on how good it looks. this could include stuff like the right furniture in the right room but that might limit how free you can be (you can't just roll the ball around and see what happens, but it'd add strategy, but could make it less fun) so maybe don't do it? (free space)
<br><br>
2021-05-25<br>
-rhythm game that uses the microphone to track your beatboxing. it'd be like ddr but instead of arrows it's kick, snare, closed hi-hat and open hi-hat. there'd probably be mod support for more and different sounds. (microphone)
<br><br>
2021-05-24<br>
-sandboxy horror multiplayer game where you have to try to make your friends get scared, and/or scream or jump or make a sound, etc. the game would be in first-person. everyone would use tools or whatever, maybe like garry's mod? idk, at that point i guess you could just make use gmod or make a mod for it. that could be cool, though idk how it'd fully work, though I guess that's what this idea is supposed to be, lol. (scream)
<br><br>
2021-05-23<br>
-two player game where one player has a red flag, and the other player has to try to stay on. the game would be top down, pixelated like binding of issac. there's also a 4 player mode with two teams. the flag people try to aim the bull to run into the other player to try to make them fall, while the bull players try to stay on even under collisions. (buffalo)
<br><br>
2021-05-22<br>
-hmm. web game where you and your friend pick a photo for your friend to look at. you can decide how long they have to look at it, but when each person gets a turn looking at the other person's image (or video actually) they have to wait the average of the two numbers (so you can't just do infinite). the photos/videos have you make you want to not look at it. idk how it'd detect this but I feel like this would be a gross game, like reddit's 50/50. (bam)
<br><br>
2021-05-21<br>
-fps kinda low poly game where you are the cameraman for different scenes of different films. you have to record the scene as they actors do their thing. at the end of the shoot your footage is scored (this would be the hardest part (felt like I said that before about a scoring system)) to determine if it's good, counting creativity into it. after you finish multiple scenes for one movie you get to see the scenes all put together and see your movie with your footage. if this was a jam game the shoots would all be for one movie that you'd see at the end. i just remembered this is kinda like that sonic dream game but you kind of just act as the cameraman. maybe to add some comedy to it make it so you can interact in the scene, like knocking stuff down or messing with the actors, which would all be included in the movie. lol (ending)
<br><br>
2021-05-20<br>
-vr game where each hand is a water rocket gun. you fly across bodies of water through hoops completing levels, shooting down at the water with your water rocket guns to lift yourself up. the game is about speed and satisfying aiming. there's also a sandbox mode where you can play around with different maps. there's also a level editor to make your own levels. (hydro)
<br><br>
2021-05-19<br>
-game styled as a gameshow where every contestant gets a certain amount of time on a random wikipedia article. then there is trivia about that random article. this game I feel would work great using GPT-3, seems like it has all the stuff that GPT-3 is shown doing well. (like answer a question in a large document, making up questions, and checking if they are true.) (game)
<br><br>
2021-05-18<br>
-game where you race with friends. you are given a fact, and your goal is to be the first one to google and find a website that is misinforming about that fact. the facts wouldn't get into politics for obvious reasons, it'd be more like misconceptions, myths, and stuff. jokes wouldn't count of course. (you)
<br><br>
2021-05-17<br>
-game where a stack of event cards are taken and shuffled (so maybe like 15 cards from a full deck or whatever), and everyone gets 20 actions cards. through each round, an event card is withdrawn and each person picks an action card to use. the game is like oregon trail but each person is fighting to be the last man standing, though the real goal is to make it to the end. maybe it'd be better if there were more cards? idk. it also depends on the amount of players. the game would have some strategy though, and lots of "damnit i knew i should've saved that card!" moments. there could also be money and shops. the setting could either be like oregon trail, or be more fun and be in space or something. maybe a literal space race? lol (cards)
<br><br>
2021-05-16<br>
-funny comedic parody of gta which takes place in a city that's flooded. instead of cars, you drive canoes, and instead of running you swim. the game is just a small parody so it'd be probably an hour of gameplay. you could buy expensive stuff like motorboats though. (flood)
<br><br>
2021-05-15<br>
-vr game where you balance stacks of plates with your finger. there are many levels where you have to hold it for a certain amount of time. at first the levels are just about balancing, but eventually they get into multi-tasking, making sure you maintain all the tasks so you don't lose, while balancing the plates. as you go on the levels get more creative with crossing the street and stuff, as well as more harder. (dumbbell)
<br><br>
2021-05-14<br>
-2d top down game like superhot (in terms of the cool feeling) where you use the toy that extends to grab stuff to grab guns and stuff to kill the enemies. it would be based on that grabbing thing, it wouldn't have the "time only moves when you move" thing. (reach)
<br><br>
2021-05-13<br>
-game where you bet on two ai's playing different games against each other. you could make this pretty cool if people were able to submit their own ai. then you could have devs trying to make cool ai, and everyone else having fun betting on which one would win. ai-sports is gonna be the next thing guys, lol. (ai)
<br><br>
2021-05-12<br>
-trivia game about different pronoucations, terms and etc for different words and stuff. like "which part of america says pop" or "which countries say po-tay-to", etc. (pop)
<br><br>
2021-05-11<br>
-warioware style game where you're presented different things, like buildings or faces, etc. each (some or all depending on difficulty/progression) feature are rotated, and you have to rotate them back into their orignal place. in the harder stages, you'll have stuff that's a bit hard to tell if it's the right way, like an eye only having eyelashes (which you might think should be on the bottom, etc). (rotate)
<br><br>
2021-05-10<br>
-multiplayer teardown mixed with the floor is lava (in a house, at least for the default map) mixed with spleef (from minecraft). (sidekick)
<br><br>
2021-05-09<br>
-fun "play for a minute every once in a while" 3d semi-top-down game where you're a superhero that can fly. around the city map are people woh need your help so you save them. stuff like cats in trees, people in burning buildings, purse robberys, bank robberys, etc. as you finish these small quests (there would be a lot of different types of quests though, maybe each have variation?) you get coins which you can use to upgrade different stats and get different powerups so you can get more money and do more quests more easily. would probably be a mobile and switch game, lol. (hero)
<br><br>
2021-05-08<br>
-vr game where you make food with powertools as hands. from pb&j sandwiches to gourmet dishes. (the powertools for your hands would depend on each level.) (jam)
<br><br>
2021-05-07<br>
-party jackbox-style party game where each person makes up a false fun fact, it's grouped with actual real fun facts and the rest of the people have to pick which one they think is the false one. maybe in the last round everyone has some time to make up a fact, then goes through each fact and people have to guess which one is false and who made it up. maybe half the people make up a false fun fact and the rest make up a true fun fact so you have to pick which one is false, and pick for all facts who you think wrote it. (university)
<br><br>
2021-05-06<br>
-vr game where you pick locks. it goes from standard locks to bank safes to crazy made up fantasy sci-fi locks. (door)

-stealth game where you try to go around your work place stealing people's supplies, lunch, documents, etc. once you get back to your desk you can craft new supplies to help you steal even more important stuff. the game is 3rd person with a simple artstyle, like octodad kind of. (approaching)
<br><br>
2021-05-04<br>
-game that forces you to exercise. you put in something that you wouldn't want to be sent to someone (you could select one person specifically, a whole bunch of people, randomly from a group, anyone, etc) as a text. you then whenever you plan on doing your workout, have to get to a random location around you in a certain time limit, after that there's another waypoint. if you don't get to those waypoints in a certain amount of time the texts are sent. after the waypoints your journey is done. this would be pretty hard to balance I think, but it'd be really configurable. like how many waypoints, time limit, distance, distance between waypoints, etc. also 500 game ideas woo!!! (500)

-fps bird simulator where you build nests, take care of your children, survive, and etc. (tree)
<br><br>
2021-05-02<br>
-top down game where police cars and bugs try to go after you. you have a ball and chain attached to your leg so at first you walk slow. but you're able to eat the ball, making you go faster the more you eat it. eating it takes time though, so you have to run away from the enemies (the levels are like in a dungeon, but maybe they could progress to the outside and stuff, maybe even with a story the end could be the top of the police building) so you can get some time to eat the ball. you win the level when you finish eating the whole ball. (burden)
<br><br>
2021-05-01<br>
-site that gives you challenges to use on omegle. stuff like make someone laugh, make someone say a certain phrase, win a game of rock paper scissors with someone, etc. there could also be a mode (that'd probably be more fun honestly) where everything has a timer, and disconnects you if you don't complete it in time. though i'd add a button to stop the timer if you like the conversation and just want to talk. :)<br>
-originally the idea above was a site like omegle for people who are sad and people who want to make them feel better, you'd select if you're sad or want to make someone's day better. (happy)
<br><br>
2021-04-30<br>
-board game like oregon trail but as a card game. bonus points if you make it about space, and use multiple planet component cards to generate random planets (that could be an game idea on it's own lol). (freedom)
<br><br>
2021-04-29<br>
-fps game where you have to babysit many babies and kids for a certain amount of time (5 or 10 minutes, depending on difficulty). the game is chaotic as you have to protect kids, treat them if they need something, clear up and conflicts, and etc. there could be score just for fun. (check)
<br><br>
2021-04-28<br>
-probably one-screen side platformer game where you play as a parkouring sheep as you have to go all over the changing map (everytime you get a score the map changes), you have to collect gems (or maybe flick a lever just by touching it) to prop open the fence in the middle that you jump over. if you don't get the gem and jump over the fence in time, the level borders (which is like a tought bubble) will burst and the person wakes back up, losing and showing your score. hopefully you get what I mean, lol. (sleep)
<br><br>
2021-04-27<br>
-online physics battle royale game where you are a truck driver trying to deliver goods, if you crash into someone and cause them to lose some or all of their supplies, you get points (and maybe/probably bonuses/benefits) for how many supplies you took off of their truck. this one sounds fun. :) (ship)
<br><br>
2021-04-26<br>
-vr game based on that scene in now you see me 2 where they have to hide that card and do crazy shiz. one team has to do the security checks, the other team have to hide the card through the security checks by hiding it, and also saying bye to physics and going ham. (ace)
<br><br>
2021-04-25<br>
-tron, but while you make trails, you also make roads. there's a single ramp in the center of the map. so if you do a jump, you make a road going up that other people can go up on. the game would work like gta online's tron. your trail is limited (it isn't a infinite length of trail) but the roads are, so at the end, there's a whole map that you and your friends have made. (dead end)
<br><br>
2021-04-24<br>
-game that uses gpt-3 or some nlp technology to make the best rock paper scissor game ever. each person gets 3 random options with random items, they pick one (maybe with a 5 or 3 second countdown as an option or as permanent to force the player to choose one quickly?) and the two players get what items they got dueled. both players get their own different items. the ai or system would determine which one would win in that duel. i don't think this would be objectively balanced, but i think it could still be fun to see how it plays it. this would be like quick, draw but for rock paper scissors. (five)
<br><br>
2021-04-23<br>
-hot potato party game but when you get the potato you have to beat a warioware-style microgame. (waste on time)
<br><br>
2021-04-22<br>
-likely userscript game where you control a top-down character with guns and stuff and you go to real webpages to blow them up. you can click on the links if you go up to them to travel to that page. your guy is small and the camera is zoomed in and centered on you. the game would be fun cause it'd be really destructive with physics i guess. this is likely inspired off the jazztronauts gamemode for gmod. i wouldn't want to make it so you only have a limited amount of time to do it but idk what othe objectives there could be. (net)
<br><br>
2021-04-21<br>
-game where you are a flea trying to avoid the spikes on a mace that tries to hit you. game is 3d 3rd person. you're a flea so you'd be able to dodge the spikes. (mace)

2021-04-18<br>
-vr game where you're in a zombie apocoalypse, traveling to a safe spot with your friend. however, something happens and your friend becomes unconcious. the goal of the game is to get to the safe spot while you have to carry your friend's body. all this while you have to shoot zombies and survive. i would imagine this to be campaign based, maybe with some environmental storytelling. i could imagine some tense moments like some subway door is gonna close and you just pull your friend in right before the door closes. (died)
<br><br>
2021-04-17<br>
-(porbably would work best as a vr) game where you're in a lab with a whole bunch of chemicals and tools. you're also presented with a line of liquids that all look like water, water being included. the goal is to use the chemicals, liquids and tools to determine which cup has the water. when you decide you drink the cup and see if you survive. (thirsty)
<br><br>
2021-04-16<br>
-full or maybe short game where you control the wind to help a leaf cross a long land. the game would have beautiful painting art, a relaxing soundtrack and a great story. the leaf would go from the forest, to the plains, to towns, etc. :) (leaf)
<br><br>
2021-04-15<br>

<br><br>
2021-04-12<br>

<br><br>
2021-04-08<br>
-game where ti shows the beginning of a countdown, then at some point it dissapears, and you have to press the button to when you think it'll reach zero. depending on how close you are is how you win. (timer)
<br><br>
2021-04-07<br>
-game where you use a program similar to Cheat Engine to cheat in a fake "online multiplayer" game (really just using super good bots, they'd be really really good to force you to cheat). (cheating)
<br><br>
2021-04-06<br>

<br><br>
2021-04-02<br>
-game where 5 npcs tell you what's going to happen, like "guy in green shirt will fall", or "gorilla walks across screen". then it plays a small randomly generated cutscene with stuff happening. at the end you have to pick who was the one who lied, and made up their statement. (i think i might start thinking of putting my mindset into thinking of warioware microgame ideas, might be easier and better and more room for creativity.) (post-fool)
<br><br>
2021-04-01<br>
-fps game where you try to speedrun falling for as many pranks as you can during the ingame day. idk how it'd work but you decide. (fool)
<br><br>
2021-03-31<br>
-program where you and a friend set each other a random payload, where it'll set your desktop wallpaper to a specific picture your friend picks, and play a sound your friend picks. you will do the same to your friend. you each get to pick any day that this will happen. so you guys will know you're pranking each other, and have no idea when it will happen. it could be a scary face with a scream, to being creative and picking their current wallpaper with fake desktop icons to confuse them as you paly a 15khz sine wave or something. lol (pre-fool)
<br><br>
2021-03-30<br>
-educational vr game where you take stuff apart and put them back together. stuff like microwaves, toasters, toys, toy cars, cars, computers, etc. (toaster)
<br><br>
2021-03-29<br>
-fps low poly with nice pallete like baby blue for living room walls, etc game where you are in a house with a cup and ping pong ball in your inventory. you can do trickshots which depending on how good it is will give you a certain amount of points. there are a bunch of modes for it, from timed, to getting the highest score, to just messing around. (bucket)
<br><br>
2021-03-28<br>
-game where you look at a face that looks a bit off, and you have to click what is off about it. there would be a timer that would go down as you play. (eyebrow)<br>
-two player game where one person edits a face slightly and shows it to the other player, if they can guess what is off about it they win and the game restarts. if they can't guess what's off about it in 10 seconds, the editor gets a point and edits it slightly again. this would go from shaving a bit of eyebrow, to slightly moving the eye, etc. (eyebrow)
<br><br>
2021-03-27<br>
-top down game with that spinning ball thing. this game would be pixelated and quirky like ds games. you spin and drag the cursor in a circle to spin the ball with more momentum, when you let go of the mouse you let go. the goal is to play catch with a friend and do this. throw it at each other to catch it. the goal is to get a high score as you can. this game would have the same style as the dsiware warioware minigames, like pyoro or the paper planes one. (pull)
<br><br>
2021-03-26<br>
-game where you are being chased by people down the city streets, and you get points for pushing people, and small props like trash cans, mailboxes, etc. the game would be top down, probably 2.5d, and would be fun and satisfying to push over people, the game would probably have some good and nice sound design (hey that rhymes). (push)
<br><br>
2021-03-25<br>
-kind of game in terms of adding onto it, but site where you submit a url, and then it checks a whole bunch of stats like language, location, size, looks, popularity, etc, to put it on a vector map (like XO or The Infinite Drum Machine). the goal would be it would put similar sites together on a plane, and it could look pretty cool. it could also be pretty cool to see and watch it grow over time as people submit sites and links. (link)
<br><br>
2021-03-24<br>
-simple game you can play with a deck of cards, pick a random card, look at it and then put it away. then get another friend who doesn't know the card, and they have to try to guess what colour it is. the catch is if the number is odd, you have to lie and say it's the other colour. if it's even then you have to tell the truth. points are only given on lie cards, lying well means you get point, if they pick the right colour then they get a point. (didn't)
<br><br>
2021-03-23<br>
-fps parkour game in a dark place where you use a flashlight that literally only flashes light. so you have to do parkour, with some flashes to help you. each level has a cool duotone colour scheme, since I think if it was just black it'd be boring and a bit scary. maybe have a cool pattern over the screen as well? idk, maybe this game could be a cool demonstration of some cool shaders. (flashes)
<br><br>
2021-03-22<br>
-vr game that is pitch black, and you have to rely on sound. the game is an escape the room type game. i wonder if blind people would be better or worse at this game? (mono)
<br><br>
2021-03-21<br>
-game where you try your best to eq something as best as you can. after you submit it shows you what a professional did to eq the audio. could be useful for educational purposes on equalizers. maybe add some other effects like compressors or whatever. (nono)
<br><br>
2021-03-20<br>
-platformer game set in a bar where you try to collect and dirnk as much alochol as you can without dying, and as you drink you get drunker, so weird effects and harder controls. (alcohol)
<br><br>
2021-03-19<br>
-aw, i hate this idea. evil game where you pick a file (that's older than a month), and you do a level of this game (maybe a platformer or something), if you win, you gian a point (which can be shown on the leaderboards), but if you lose, that file you picked gets deleted. so you risk losing precious files to increase your rank on the leaderboard. this would be the one game where i'd respect the top people on the leaderboard. maybe have the number of files they lost to beside it? or maybe just leave it out as a mystery, that could be cool. (gotta do it)
<br><br>
2021-03-18<br>
-vr game where you chop as much food as you can in a minute without cutting yourself. (quick)
<br><br>
2021-03-17<br>
-top down (maybe) game where you have to get from a to b. there are enemies (maybe zombies?) that try to go to you and punch you, but you are holding to jugs. you can swing these jugs at them to hurt and kill them. but the jugs have water in them with physics, so you have to try to not spill as much to withstand the requirement to complete the level. also there could be another thing where the jugs have acid that hurt anyone who touches it (including the player) (jug)
<br><br>
2021-03-16<br>
-mobile game with short timer and score system. you have three primary colours, and drag one colour onto the other to mix it. the top of the screen shows the colour to reproduce. once you get the right colour, you drag it onto the top to add a score. the colours get more complicated, and the timer gets shorter as you progress. your goal is to try to get a higher score than your current high score. (green)
<br><br>
2021-03-15<br>
-vr game where you try to take cheese out of a mouse trap. (hesitate)

2021-03-14<br>
-multiplayer game where you have 1 minute to swing around the jungle, grabbing ropes in first person, trying to grab and collect the bananas. if you drop, you drop 2 bananas and then respawn, which other players can take. player with most bananas at the end of the game wins. could also add a team mode, and maybe even more game modes if it's really fun. (monkey)
<br><br>
2021-03-13<br>
-game with marble blast camera where you roll a cube. you have to try to get to the goal. the catch is that there is a certain side, that if you land on it (so it touches the ground), you die. you could do some cool stuff like flipping and stuff to try not to touch the side. i could imagine super mario 64 half-a-press explaination type videos for this game, speedruns could be really cool and be technical. this would be a interesting game to see the reception. (side)
<br><br>
2021-03-12<br>
-trading card game where the cards you collect are components to make your own characters. so take pokemon tcg for example, there would be cards to define their stats and attacks, as well as name components and character designs (using different features maybe with clear plastic, or different sections of the art). if it was simple you could just stack the cards in a way to see all of them, but it'd probably be better to make special sleeves that hold each card in place, and you could swap. this would incourage creativity, be really strategic, and have the "even a noob might have the chance to beat the pro if they have a good strength against their weakness and/or is just good" kind of thing. (odd)
<br><br>
2021-03-11<br>
-jackbox party like game where a game template is picked, (platformer, shmup, etc), and people are given 10 seconds to draw what the game tells them to draw. like the player's head, or a bullet, or a coin, etc. then they have to make a level in 30 seconds. then, some players can work on making the text (like game over and stuff) in 8 seconds, while the other players have to place some random notes down to make a song in 15 seconds. afterwards, everyone gets their own sort of game. where each asset came from instinctive creatitivty due to the time limit, and if some assets combine together, can make some cool stuff. (triple)
<br><br>
2021-03-10<br>
-two+ player game where you pick a popular thing in media (like batman), and are given either the instruction to read a fact (like ex, in batman issue blah, there is a character named blah. or, in the show sailer moon, the villain's name is blah. or like, in 1986 nintendo tried to sue blah for blah or whatever), but there's also one where it gives you a media, and you have to make up a fact. the other players then guess if the fact was made up or is real, the winner is the one with the most points at the end of the game. this game would have a lot of "wait that's real!?" and "i thought that was real!" (lol) and stuff. (mario)
<br><br>
2021-03-09<br>
-game which is a site where you generate qr codes, you then put these qr codes somewhere hidden in the real world. people can then find them. they can also read the text underneath that talks about what the game is and how to play it. when scanned the user get's a point, the goal is to find as many qr codes as you can. it'd be cool to have it so you can hide as many qr codes and you'd like, but i'm not sure how to combat abuse or cheating. (travel)
<br><br>
2021-03-08<br>
-jackbox party like game where everyone writes a line, some people will write a line that rhymes with a word, then after that, people get a list of random lines from other people, and stitch them together to make a rap. then it is demonstrated and people vote for if one side one or the other, then going to the next match. this is similar to that rap city game and i hope i didn't just copy it, lol. (mashup)
<br><br>
2021-03-07<br>
-game with stages where you have a grappling hook and fly through space, trying to get to the goal while avoiding hot stars, you can ride one some moving stars. the game is focused on being fast, and kind of similar to clustertruck. (star)
<br><br>
2021-03-06<br>
-game where you have a list of ingredients but you don't have the porpotions so you have to decide the numbers yourself and make a balanced meal. (peace)
<br><br>
2021-03-05<br>
-vr game where you have a bucket and try to collect as much gas in the air as you can. (gas)
<br><br>
2021-03-04<br>
-clicker heros but the whole site is one big multiplayer thing. so everyone who plays contributes. the enemies obviously increase in difficulty so you don't get a seizure from the enemy pictures changing. the game would have ms paint like graphics and could use randomization to generate random enemies using different parts. (double click)
<br><br>
2021-03-03<br>
-platformer game with different stages where your mouse cursor has physics. it can fall, it can go on conveyors and trampolines, you can literally drag it across the floor, and if you fling up you can almost pull it up with an impulse. you can't like drag it and hold it up though, just like throwing it up. the goal is to dodge any harmful stuff and get to the goal. if you want, you don't have to, but making the game windows themed would be cool. (idk why i said that like i was talking to someone lol) (mouse)
<br><br>
2021-03-02<br>
-game where you try to look for bugs in the game to break the fourth wall. the game's story would be about the character realizing they're just living in a game, and could be a long game with an emotional story, using intentional bugs as puzzles. i think that game could be a good hit. :) (climax)
<br><br>
2021-03-01<br>
-party game where you text your friend as people watch, the goal is to tell your friend something like "zim the lizard passed away" or "i am sad" or whatever, just random stuff that could be true or not (but most likely fictional silly fun). the twist is that you have to try to make sure the audience watching doesn't get the message. idk how you can have the audience submit a vote, you could just have each person guess after some timer, and have a human decide who won. if the person doesn't get the message then they lose and everyone else but them gets a point or something idk. anyways the goal is to try to tell a message secretly, in public. (keyboard)
<br><br>
2021-02-28<br>
-site where you are told to make a melody, chord progression, drums, bass, etc using the piano roll snapped to a scale. then after, the site will pick random submissions, making long melodys, making arrangements to make a community-made song that is put in the gallery. each song has its own key, scale, tempo and even instruments. you'd be able to hear the note you placed when you place it. could be a fun experiment. (generated music)
<br><br>
2021-02-27<br>
-game try to make the other person do something in 30 seconds. both people have their mic on, and one is told to make the other person cringe, laugh, annoyed, or even cry (probably hard mode). the goal for the other person is to be silent, and not succumb to the other player's sounds. (sound)
<br><br>
2021-02-26<br>
-fps game with 3 players. on is a security guard in the middle and has to look on two sides to catch a player trying to cross an obstacle course with a glass pane in the middle. the guys on the side have to try to cross without being caught. the players on the sides get to look at the security guard through a one-way glass. hope this made sense. (late)
<br><br>
2021-02-25<br>
-game where you match up with 3 random people (so 4 in total) and have to perform on a stage together. the stuff you have to do is random, so "musical", "barbershop quartet", "comedy scene", "psa", etc. it's the ultimate improv game. the audience is also real people. (note)
<br><br>
2021-02-24<br>
-experimental vr game. someone drives the car, having to pay attention, and everyone else has to sit there and can't take off the headset (or everyone loses). the road trip lasts 5 hours, and the goal is to see if everyone can wait, and if the driver can pay attention the whole time. the amount of players recommended is 4 players. (b)
<br><br>
2021-02-23<br>
-site where you can sculpt your own figurine and have an iframe to put it on your site. the site detects stuff and basically makes it so the iframe can only be on one page and site at a time. then, users can also have their own shelf, and when you see a action figure you can add it to your shelf, the figure is still there of course as well for othe people to collect. it just makes it so you can have a collection of cool creative figurines found by exploring the net. (action figure)
<br><br>
2021-02-22<br>
-3d fps chase game where one player chases another player with a satisfying swinging grappling hook, and the other runs away parkouring mirrors edge style with tight satisfying controls. the only game any player would play any team. (top of a building)
<br><br>
2021-02-21<br>
-you know those sites where it's like drawing telephone? like the first person has to draw "a helicopter dancing" for example, then the second person has to guess what the drawing is, with the third person drawing the second persons guess? well take that to the extreme. have random events that sometimes occurs, like flipping or mirror images, changing the words for synonyms, telling the drawer to draw the opposite, move and wrap the image, make the person have to draw upside-down, etc. this would be on a site where anyone can participate in an ongoing event. of course at the end you'd be able to view its history. this would be a collaboration of a whole bunch of people to eventually produce this weird image. depending on the website's activity would be how many cycles the image would go through, no point having 10 rounds if the site isn't popular at all. 2 or 3 cycles would be best at that point. though maybe when you start an event have the option for more? up to 10? i'm not sure. cycles would have both drawing and typing. (weird)
<br><br>
2021-02-20<br>
-game similar to warioware. you play a minigame, and at some point randomly it will switch to a new minigame. the goal is to not lose at any of the minigames. maybe you'll have lives? idk. (switch)
<br><br>
2021-02-19<br>
-vr game where you are a barber. you get to look at someones hair and what hairstyle they want, and then the screen fades to black. so you have to cut their hair blind. there is a mode that enables an outline of the person's head (but not hair). (hair)
<br><br>
2021-02-18<br>
-3d 3rd person game where you are a bug trying to avoid people walking, crumbs being dropped, etc. (footstep)
<br><br>
2021-02-17<br>
-rhythm game where you can hold up to stay in air for a long time, and hold down to go down quickly. the goal of the game is that you're platforming across music sheet notes, the camera is autoscroll. the goal is to hit the notes rhytmically. i'm not sure if it'd be possible to have it so you have to land on them when they'd play, or just on the beat of the song. the music would be nice jazz pieces. (jazz)

-game where a planet is being shot at, and you are a in space and try to protect the planet by shooting the bad guys, as well as catching any people flying out of the planet and nice-guy-ships. some of the people that you rescue can help you by shooting as well, or increasing your health faster or whatever. then some of the people you rescued might join your crew and help you save other planets. this is a bit of stretch but maybe have it so you can be the bad guys, catching the people who fly away and making them work for you, some might start to believe you and want to work with you. then you can fight against the bad guys in multiplayer as well, and not just singleplayer or whatever. also, some of your crew can have their own spaceship, each with behaviors, so some might stay close to your ship, some might just fight a little in the distance, being able to help you when you need it, or just doing their own thing taking care of the other side of the planet or whatever. the game would be 3d and 3rd person of the spaceship. and would be pretty fun. (planet)

-game where there there is a small neural network that tries to solve mazes, so it's human like but still can be fooled. the site (though i think it'd be more charm as a program) has a voting system, so you have to draw a maze (start, walls, goal) for the ai to figure out. it shows how long the ai takes, and you're also able to draw some cool stuff. so the top voted thing would be a nicely drawn thing that takes the ai a long time to solve, with a player with controls and stuff. it'd be pixelated like flipnote studio style. (maze)
<br><br>
2021-02-14<br>
-game where you are a god answering questions about your universe, questions you get are random and decide what your world will be like as it runs it's simulation. things will come up that will need you to answer more questions. the simulation would generate text entries on what's happening, as well as an "encyclopedia" (nested by orteil style) for your universe. the text entries would be stuff you could actually read on your own for a bit, and would be fun and interesting to see it run. as well as the stats of the universe. the universes would include galaxys, solar systems, planets, regions, etc. as well as unique people, plants, places, etc. basically almost a game that generates news and nested-style things by you answering questions to set parameters sort the court style. (why)
<br><br>
2021-02-13<br>
-virtual board game where you and players try to prepare as much as you can for a nuclear apocoalypse. at a random turn, the bombs launch, and everyone sits back as the simulation manages what happens next, and who survives the longest. this ranges from buying bunkers, to being the mayor your town or city, to the food you have, being a farmer, etc. the game is strategy and would have a few interactions between players, but also doing something that stops an opponent from doing something, giving them that "darn" kind of thing like in board games. (bomb)
<br><br>
2021-02-12<br>
-based of an old flash game. twine game, or maybe visual novel, or maybe even bitsy style game where you're a detective solving a case. there are many times where you can die, and if you do, that's it. it's impossible without clearing your cookies or switching to a different browser/pc. the whole point is that you would use the one chance you have to try to play it smart and be careful. you truly only have 1 life in that game. you win the game if you can find and get the culprit in jail without dying. (killing me)
<br><br>
2021-02-11<br>
-game where the tv doesn't work, so you can to mangle with the attena, other electronics, stuff around the house and ceiling and stuff. the game is first person. maybe it'd be better as vr so you can ould grab the attena and bend it or something? idk. (doesn't)
<br><br>
2021-02-10<br>
-3d fps game where you are a rocket trying to avoid stars to fly to a planet. you can shoot the stars and they explode into multiple pieces, almost like asteroid. you are just trying to get to one location, like in starfox you're just going in a straight path. (star)
<br><br>
2021-02-09<br>
-game where you try to do stuff like "go to coffee pot", or "talk to jimmy", as you walk around busy areas, trying to stay two meters apart from people. people might come up to you to try to talk to you, or you might have to go through a crowd of people. the game is almost top down (little bit of an angle) tilted, 3d, almost "corporate art style" with big circle bodies. you can move all cardinal directions (with your legs and arms being a little ragdolly and silly), and you're other button is "excuse me", which *tries* to tell people to get out of the way, but might not always work. maybe there could a random (out of a bunch of) voice line when you hit the button or something idk. (space)
<br><br>
2021-02-08<br>
-two player game where you have to try to solve as many questions as you can under a time. the questions are simple math stuff like additino and usbtraction, but you also have to read how to do the answer wrong (or right). so maybe it'll say "make your question off by 1" or "swap the first two digits" or something. so you can have more skill and chance to win than just being good at math. (number)
<br><br>
2021-02-07<br>
-vr game where you can only use one hand grabbing the handle of a shovel, and you have to try to bury a body. the game is hard like getting over it. (sand)
<br><br>
2021-02-06<br>
-car arena game where you can drift easily and fun, and you have to try to break your opponents car by ramming into each other. you could do cool drift swings and stuff. and make have some cool maps with ramps and stuff, and maybe have bits and bobs come off your car with collisions. this could just be a fun game to play. (car)
<br><br>
2021-02-05<br>
-two online multiplayer game where it's tag with your mouse cursors. you have a max speed though (that's still kind of fast so you don't feel limited, but is still possible to catch) and there's walls that the mouse collides with. (mouse)
<br><br>
2021-02-04<br>
-game similar to those "dark room but when you die you explode and show a bit of the light", but instead of you exploding you drop your flashlight. there could be a double-jump, but also a way to kind of "aim" your flashlight, or at least have it point left and right. the levels would be designed so you couldn't just not die once (unless you already know the level). (flashlight)
<br><br>
2021-02-03 (second time i missed a day damnit i was so close to a full year)<br>
-game where you make dams to make the world rotate a certain to to get a coin, get points as timer for each point runs down. (double damnit)
<br><br>
2021-02-01<br>
-3rd person but almost top down game (or even have the camera pretty low, to where you couldn't see over the half of their head or something idk) where you're a cute creature in a cute city (full of other cute creatures) where you blow buildings up, the buildings then fall down so you have to make sure you don't die from them. either you have a limited amount of time to get a high score, or destroying the city gives you money to destroy more of the city. i'm not sure how to make an incentive but the game would be fun. (damnit)
<br><br>
2021-01-31<br>
-sort of open world platformer game where you can switch wearing different masks. these masks let you see a world in a different way, from spotting hidden treasures, to seeing hidden doors, invisible objects, etc. as well as no mask, which is just normal view. each mask has their own colour scheme, the whole screen tinted a colour (like red) and the highlighted objects in another colour (like cyan). each mask has a funky color scheme, but toned down a bit. the game is a little inspired off majora's mask, but is also a linear platformer, while also being a bit open so you can feel cool for unlocking masks. maybe it could be a metroidvania? i'm not sure. also maybe have it so you can buy masks, and maybe have a limited amount on you, so you have to be strategic. but i guess that breaks using the masks for solving levels and, idk whatever. maybe it's a speedrun game and that's how you be strategic and masks just help you or something? idk. (space mask)
<br><br>
2021-01-30<br>
-game where you grab branches to swing at saplings to knock them down. then you knock down big saplings with the small saplings, eventually getting to knocking down huge trees with big trees. the game would be fun to knock them down. the game is top down, and you would grab and swing trees in a circle like sm64. you could walk around knocking down trees, but if a tree is too big and you swing into it it'll just stop the momentum. you have 1 minute to get as much as a high score as you can. maybe 2 or 3, maybe even 5 minutes just to have some more time to have fun with it. (lumberyard)
<br><br>
2021-01-29<br>
-idle game where as you wait stuff collects in your couch cushions, you can get stuff to sell, as well as finding money directly. you can then use the money to upgrasde couches and upgrades and stuff. this game would be satisfying to wait, and then collect all your built-up rewards. (not found)
<br><br>
2021-01-28<br>
-game where one player flips a virtual coin 25 times, and another player tries to make up a random sequence of heads or tails and other players decide which is the fake one. this game shows how humans understand randomness. (dogecoin)
<br><br>
2021-01-27<br>
-pictionary but describing sounds with drawings. (wow)
<br><br>
2021-01-26<br>
-game where you run a simulation in a window, you can start new save and let it run. the world evolves and stuff. you can pause and save at anytime. you can then combine and breed two save files to make a new breded one. this is like ultimate prestiege. the original parents also die, so you have to decide if you want to use this current save file or let it run more and see if it'll get better or worse. the game would be designed like old visual basic 6 games, using windows ui, full reds, greens, blues, yellows and stuff, would have a cute doodly artstyle for any graphics that are in the game. the ui could also be like windows 98 or windows xp, i'm feeling like windows 10 running old programs kind of style though, though not the caption bar. (world end)
<br><br>
2021-01-25<br>
-top down game where you aim with your mouse, move with wasd. you are in the center of a mob with 1000 monsters (you're a yellow circle and the enemies are blue circles), at 1000 you have a submachine gun that blasts all the enemies in a fun manner. then at 250 you have a shotgun that kills chunks, then at 100 you have the pistol that can go through multiple enemies, then at 50 you have the glock that can shoot fast, then at 10 you have a sniper to do big satisfying shots at enemies with. the whole point is you downgrade your weapons, but for a more fun experience. i feel like this game would be something that's for some reason fun and kind of addicting. this could be something i make. (big number)
<br><br>
2021-01-24<br>
-game with scratch like programming, you see a bot playing a game, and have replicate that behavior as best as you can. i guess this is actually something someone could do right now, with scratch or even other programming languages. but this would be like trying to replicate an ai's behavior. pretty neato. (carbon copy)
<br><br>
2021-01-23<br>
-game where you run around a basketball gym with a whole bunch of hoops on the walls. random basketballs bounce from different sides and you can pick them up and slam dunk them into one of the nets. you have a limited amount of time to try to get your highest score. the game could be top-down or 3rd person. i feel this could be fun but is empty, so you'd have to play it right to keep its funness. idk. (slam dunk)
<br><br>
2021-01-22<br>
-game that i might do for 51/365, gives you the name of a random trope from tv tropes and the laconic, you the host sees both the name and defintion (which is the laconic thing of the trope page), and your friends have to try to guess it. they have 1:30, and if one of them says the right definition they get a point. (tvtropes)
<br><br>
2021-01-21<br>
-game where you run by typing to the rhythm. i went down a japanese speed typing rabbit hole and came across these cool japanese rhyhtm games where you typed i believe the lyrics to the beatmap (like with different rhythms). i don't think you can do this in english, at least not to the lyrics, because in japanese a character can be a single syllable. but you can't do that with english. but you could just break it down, so like "hello" could just be "h" and "o", or "l" and "o". forget the running thing, i just thought of the cool japanese typing rhythm game and would like to see it become a thing in english. maybe i could do it and make the next osu. :eyes: (run)
<br><br>
2021-01-20<br>
-game where you read scrolling text and have to try to click and spot the mistakes. includes stuff liek double 'the' on different lines, mispelled words, and could even have it so the text takes place in america (showing that before you read it) and having british spellings of words as a mistake. bonus points for a mode where you have to type it all before it scrolls by, as well as fixing all of the mistakes as you write it down. this game would definitely require soem concetration. lol (focus)
<br><br>
2021-01-19<br>
-two player or party game where you are a guy in a room (gang beasts kind of view), and you can grab stuff and make a mess. the challenge is, all players have a minute or two (should be a choice, could go up to 3 or even 5 minutes with a big map) to make as much as a mess as they can (each player is splitscreen in their own room), when the players press the big red button, that saves the messy status, and then the players have to clean up what they just done. after the game, people who failed to clean up are disqualified, and the person who had the messiest room when they hit the button wins. this would require strategic thinking, as you have to go as far as you can, but walk back the way you came. (mess)
<br><br>
2021-01-18<br>
-jackbox style party game where one player makes a 2 or 3 (probably 2) (actually probably 1) minute play with two characters. two other players wait, and then get their script (with only their lines) to memorize. they get to try to memorize it for a minute or two. after, the play begins and the actors have to try to act, as they try to remember their lines. the rule is to just go with it. the game tries to stress test player's memory for fun and laughs. maybe have it so all players write a script at the same time, and then they wait for the rest. the goal for each player, is to write a script that is too hard for you friends to remember (probably have a character limit for each line to prevent cheating) while being good at remembering and acting your lines, as the audience aka the other players rate it either during or after the play. (forgot)
<br><br>
2021-01-17<br>
-game that follows the drawabox lessons. you open it, it has a nice drawing program and tells you what to draw. then the next day you open the program you move on to next day's lesson. (augh)
<br><br>
2021-01-16<br>
-game where you 3d sculpt wings for a bird to fly through, with the goal to go the furthest distance. the game uses a accurate aerodynamics simulation. you can choose to sculpt one wing and duplicate for the other, or edit each wing individually. bonus points to have a mode to set the wind and weather to what it's like irl in your real location. otherwise there's the normal mode with no external forces, and a sandbox mode to mess around with the parameters. i guess you could also sculpt the actual bird model. maybe even have a paper airplane mode where you virtually fold a paper airplane. that would be hard to simulate i assume but whatever, it could be fun. (it would also be better if it was vr compatible, but i think it'd be cool to play it without needing vr.) (bird)
<br><br>
2021-01-15<br>
-platformer game where you have 3 lives. you beat this one one-screen level, and then restart. the path that you made is now made of coins which add to your score. keep going until you run out of all three lives. (again)
<br><br>
2021-01-14<br>
-vr multiplayer game where you and your friends can do band stuff. the instruments can be the regular piano, guitar, drumkits, etc. but there are also simpler instruments, like a piano with only the notes of a scale and such, this way, people can be easily introduced to making music and make something good. the game also allows you to record your songs, use your own samples, and make your own instruments. (choir)
<br><br>
2021-01-13<br>
-game where your mouse is a certain brush size. if you drag back and forth it makes friction and makes that section of the screen go from blue to orange. it then fades back to blue after. the goal is to have the whole screen orange, or warm. this would be a challenge, but possible. (warm)
<br><br>
2021-01-12<br>
-fighting game that uses chords, arpeggios, etc on the piano for combos. maybe have the keyboard as an option. midi.city and other sites can use the keyboard as a piano keyboard thing. (music)
<br><br>
2021-01-11<br>
-vr game where a line of cups on a belt move towards you. they stop, so you can take your time. except you have a minute as there is a table with coasters that slide across it, you have to put these cups on the coasters. different cups and coasters give you different amount of points. after the minute, the game shows you your points. maybe have some people walk by and you have to put cups on their coasters. maybe add liquid. etc, these obstacles could help make a full game. (coast)
<br><br>
2021-01-10<br>
-game where you bring a sword to a gun fight. you move your sword like in getting over it, but you can move normally (side scroller platformer style) with wasd. your sword can deflect bullets, and is how you "shoot". you can also just try to stab your enemies to get their hp lowered. the game is similar to nidhogg. (clash)
<br><br>
2021-01-09<br>
-game where you perform cpr with the right pace while other rhythms (at different tempos) play in the background. are you able to focus on your own beat to save a life? (pressure)
<br><br>
2021-01-08<br>
-two player game with a panel with a whole bunch of buttons, gadgets, levers, etc. one friend has to copy the other friend as much as they can. and the copyee has to try to fool the copier. game stops when copier messes up or is too late. (same)
<br><br>
2021-01-07<br>
-fps puzzle game. you can mute the sound with the mute button, which helps your character not blown by the audiowaves that speakers make. but the audiowaves (or wind) could be helpful. the mute button of course mutes the actual audio as well. (mute)
<br><br>
2021-01-06<br>
-multiplayer fps basketball sandbox game where you can invite your friends. you can either play actual basketball, horse (so have some cool stuff in the map to mess around with, maybe trampolines and foam pits or something?), or whatever game you wanna do, or even just mess around. (challenge)
<br><br>
2021-01-05<br>
-game maker thing with your friend. one friend picks the goal/objective, one friend picks the catch/enemy/"but", and both players make a level. at the end the two players play the game. bonus points for being able to save games, share them (could just have levels be files and let users share them themselves) and different modes to play the games. like racing, or point based, or both. (game)
<br><br>
2021-01-04<br>
-visual novel game about social engineering to hack a company. (cyber)
<br><br>
2021-01-03<br>
-game where you look at a randomly generated city top down pixel with random thing doing on like people wearing silly things or weird cars or whatever weird events like superheros of performances, your goal is to write in your journal as much as you can see what happened. game uses nlp to see what you got and tells you how many events you missed. the goal is to be able to document all the things that happened. you look at the city for like an minute. (update)
<br><br>
2021-01-02<br>
-had an idea for an fps adventure game mechanic i'd like to use. hold a button and nod by looking. this is how you can say yes or no. you could also do like "'sup" to start conversations or something. maybe an adventure fps game where you interact with npcs by looking (holding the button when you're doing gestures). (yes)
<br><br>
2021-01-01 (ayy)<br>
-game where you press the spacebar. you have to try to press exactly when a new second strikes. the site tells you if you got it. you also get more points if you do a combo. assuming this is really hard to do maybe it saves your score so next time you go on the page your score is back? a leaderboard would be cool but idk if it could be easily cheated. probably. (new year)
<br><br>
2020-12-31<br>
-2d platformer game where you wake up and realize you only have 10 minutes until the world is destroyed. you have to do entries on your randomly generated to-do list in the sorta-big open world. like say hi to your neighboor, or jump on your bosses desk, get milk, etc. (last day)
<br><br>
2020-12-30<br>
-game where you are a giant boot that moves by jumping, and hopping. when you hop you do a full 360 degree flip. so you have to make sure to land everytime. when you crush something you bounce off of it too, like in mario. get to the goal of the levels. :) (crunch)
<br><br>
2020-12-29<br>
-walking simulator where you walk around a nice japanese styled town with a microphone. you can reocrd your footsteps, or put your microphone closer to objects to record their sounds more. like birds, wind rustling through trees, waterfalls, etc. then wheny ou get home you can use the samples you recorded in a nice music maker to make lofi beats. the game i guess would be a game with great sound design. (lofi)
<br><br>
2020-12-28<br>
-game that uses your mic and you have to see how long you can hold a note, both checking when you stop and also if you go off tune. maybe there's a mode where you can breathe out and get some air and return back to the note, but still checks if you're on pitch. this would be hard to do but i think would be a fun challenge (maybe have a delayed gate or something? idk). (om)
<br><br>
2020-12-27<br>
-game where you are presented a 16x16 picture that was scaled down to be 8x8. you are given a pallete, a 16x16 canvas, and 30 seconds (or a minute) to recreate the original sprite (you're only shown the 8x8 one). after the game will compare and show you the differences of yours and the true original. (scale)
<br><br>
2020-12-26<br>
-game where you are in a room with a vault and a door. you can't open the vault cause you don't know the password, so you go in the door. the door is locked from the outside though, and now you are stuck in the room the door led to. there is a note saying the password of the vault, and once you put it away, it vanishes forever. you use your phone and help is on the way in a year, in real life. so when you boot up the game after a real life year, then they open the door, and you can go to the vault, and if you remember the password from a year ago then you get to open the vault and win! (idk what the prize would be though) (also the password could be randomly generated so you actually have to remember it, and maybe it could be linked with your steam account if the game was one there so it stays when you switch pc's or something, unless you switch a steam account but whatever.) (and if you cheat, well then there's not point to the game then and you don't really feel any satisfaction from doing so.) (post)
<br><br>
2020-12-25<br>
-game like that tissue game where you try to get all the tissues out, you have to try to open all the layers of wrapping paper on a present. (christmas)
<br><br>

-game where you roll a ball of yarn and then you control the yarn, you have to try to get your rope around as many things as you can, without touching your rope or the obstacles (including the things you are trying to circle). (yarn)
<br><br>
2020-12-23<br>
-website where when you go on it or reload it picks a random number with the same odds as the lottery. if you win there'll be confetti, and it'll add to the text saying "X people have won the lottery!" (eve)
<br><br>
2020-12-22<br>
-game like minecraft. you start the game in a spaceship with other players, the games is rp based. you crashland into a random part of a huge planet, each region having random terrain and minerals, so each region looks really cool. you live your life as you explore other regions and meet other species. the game could also just be a minecraft modpack on a minecraft server. that could be fun if you actually got serious rp. (rp)
<br><br>
2020-12-21<br>
-fps game with warioware pace. you can pick up objects source engine style. you are given an objective on a tv screen as you are sitting in a room full of stuff. you have to do what it says in the short timer. so break a cup, or move the couch to the other side of the room, or gently turn your table and have all the stuff slide off of it without breaking. the game could have calming piano music playing from a radio, with a cozy atomosphere, and a relaxing tv thing, as you are stressing about holding cups and stuff. lol (do)
<br><br>
2020-12-20<br>
-roguelike but above ground so like overworld rpg. items are randomly generated with random stats, but also random enchantments. you can talk to people, who talk like they used tracery.io, then depending on how you talk (there can be options for how you respond, like being nice or an insult or whatever) and using the stats of the random npc determines how they will respond, so they might try to attack you if you hurt their feelings and they aren't afraid to hurt, or maybe halfway through they don't want to kill. maybe if you compliment them enough then their relationship threshold will be fuffiled and they'll give you a random present. monsters and dungeons are also randomly generated of course, but there are also structures in the overworld. the game generates a random world, with random key locations to help you on your randomly generated plot. things like the plot would probably be generated by something like tracery.io and parsed by the game. tracery kind of has its charm with procgen and also feeling the same, but it's different. idk, it's really weird but also cool, idk. (gen)
<br><br>
2020-12-19<br>
-rhythm heaven but with friends. you could have it so for example with two players, if it was like a game of catch, then it's not like each player presses it at the same time, but only when they catch it. so there could be some variety in there. idk. (march)
<br><br>
2020-12-18<br>
-chat program where you can only send a message to a contact per day. to make this a game idea include a streaks feature like snapchat. (break)
<br><br>
2020-12-17<br>
-game like clustertruck but with airplanes and a grappling hook. (fly)
<br><br>
2020-12-16<br>
-website where you register and gain access to a list of files hosted. okay so like, it's a file host. when you register, you have to upload one file per day or else your account gets deleted. when you're logged in, you get to see the hosted files by most recent. and you can only see the files of today, or maybe if your account was made 2 days ago, you'd also be able to see the history 2 days ago, though the only per day seems more easier to host, though maybe it should be forever but it's the just links that are toggled visiblity? idk. but it could be fun, and maybe a little weird. O_o (free)
<br><br>
2020-12-15<br>
-game where you swing hammers at targets by using your mouse first person to grab and throw them like you would in Garry's Mod with one of the physics guns. (hit)
<br><br>
2020-12-14<br>
-game like collab-vm and also parsec (so multiple people control it at the same time, maybe with different cursors for each player), perhaps one player tries to do something simple as the other players try to mess them up. and/or you have the ultimate game where a team of people try to protect the computer and a team of people try to destroy it. that would be pretty fun actually. i mean the collab-vm code is open source so it can be done. (game)
<br><br>
2020-12-13<br>
-game where you have to try to focus on something like a video and either there are artifical distractions or other players try to distract you. maybe this is like first person for the watcher and 3rd person for the distractor? idk. (squirrel)
<br><br>
2020-12-12<br>
-game where you are presented a sentence with a word that has different spellings, like "hay how are you", and the player picks if there's a misnomer word or not. so the example I gave with be wrong, so if you picked that you'd be right. the game would have a timer so you have to do this quickly and quicker as it progresses. stuff like "your welcome" and "their on their way" would show up too. (also "to", since I just mispelled too, lol.) (hey)

station knob. the game is a big story, could be about
a DJ or some random dude asking for help in a
post-apocalyptic world. idk. 
<br><br>
2020-02-25<br>
-game where you tie your shoes. you move the left string,
which mirrors on the right (but flipped vertically). at
first you can tie your shoes normally but then there are
obstacles like spikes that get in your way. there could
also be stuff to manipulate the laces, providing more
methods and obstacles. idk. 
<br><br>
2020-02-24<br>
-game where the player makes up a random gesture, which
generates an action based on that gesture. like if the player
swipes up, the player would jump. if the player does a zig-zag
then something will happen. the actions from the gesture are
not pre-programmed, they are generated. idk.
<br><br>
2020-02-23 (ayy)<br>
-platformer game where you can only move when you close your
eyes, making the screen go black. you are still when your
eyes are open.
<br><br>
2020-02-22<br>
-game where you are given random pictures. the pictures are
weird creatures you've never seen before. you have to
classify them as A or B (there'll be random names). when you
guess, you will be told if you are right. you have to figure
out what creatures are which. the game gets harder and harder
adding more options, breeds to creatures, transformations to
the image and so on.
<br><br>
2020-02-21<br>
-game where you spam the space. you have to get to exactly
party 100 in the shortest time possible. when you think you 
got 100 then press enter or something. if you didn't get
100 then you lose. so you have to spam the button exactly
100 times, and then submit your number as fast as you can.
idk.<br>
^edit 2020-02-22: you can make the game more difficult by
not allowing the player to see how many times they've
clicked.
<br><br>
2020-02-20<br>
-game where it presents a pattern with shapes. you have
to get the pattern right and move to the next one. you have
to do these fast, cause there's a timer. if the timer runs

"it goes square then circle then repeat") idk.
<br><br>
2020-02-19<br>
-game where you switch bodies with an alien from another
world. you have to get used to their school system, jobs,
social norms and etc. thinking visual novel. could also be
some cool message about our currenty society. idk.
<br><br>
2020-02-18<br>

<br><br>
2020-02-17<br>

<br><br>
2020-02-14<br>
-game where two players are on a spinning converyor belt.

opponent go to your fist. idk.
<br><br>
2020-02-13<br>

without crossing your trail. 
<br><br>
2020-02-11<br>
-top down game where you survive in a procedural-generated
world. items are pushed like blocks in sokoban. push an axe
into a tree to cut it down. create entire rooms full with
items. there was a switch game i think was about sorting
a warehouse with this similar concept, (i came up with the
idea before i saw the game tho) the art style looks cool.
so maybe something like that? (not roguelike style though,
have more colour and stuff.)
<br><br>
2020-02-10<br>
-game where you have to do impressions of voices/characters.
bot or ai will detect how close you are to the real voice and

<br><br>
2020-02-09<br>
-game like papers please where you do taxes for aliens. you

of course, like papers please there could be a story about
tax evasion. (yoshi no!)
<br><br>
2020-02-08<br>
-platformer where you can only move horizontally if you jump.
this is like playing a mario game but always crouching.
-game where you have a gun, the gun is alive, and also gets
angry. you have to make it angry for it to let out all the
rage and shoot. not sure how you can make it angry though.<br>
-maybe 3d, fps or point and click game where you are in
different scenarios. you are really tired and you want to go
to bed. you have to go to bed as fast as you can, while not
doing hard tasks that make you sleep. so maybe go from work
to your bed, having to decide if you should do something or
a different thing and which will not make you more tired,
as you try to go as fast as possible.
<br><br>
2020-02-07<br>

bounce onto the earth. maybe later you have to move the moon
and sun, as well as their rotation. maybe they have a shield
which covers up half of it or something.<br>
(sorry for the lack of game ideas each day btw, i'll try to
get some more game ideas tommorow or something.)
<br><br>
2020-02-06<br>

same time, and then another person calls. see where i'm going
with this? help mulitple people on the phone at once.<br>
-game where you have to skip rope yourself. there's three
characters, the edges holding the rope. click and drag on them
spinning in circles for them to turn their arm. then drag the

edge guys spin the rope and jump over it. if the rope hits you
or you're too slow then you lose.<br>
-anonimity (for tommorow)
<br><br>
2020-02-04<br>
-this is gonna be a confusing one. 3d game where you play inside 
of a sphere. your goal is to hit the ball so it stays above the 
ground, like in volleyball. when you hit the ball into the air,
the sphere kinda goes inside out and shows the opponent. this is
probably a idea you would need to flesh out but it seems cool.<br>
-adventurer mode from dwarf fortress. except the history has
three stages, historic, present and future. your character can do
whatever they want in the world. and if they are able to use a
time machine, go to one of the three time periods and explore.
<br><br>
2020-02-03<br>
-game where you shoot cans by throwing cans that you have knocked
down. basically shooting enemies with enemies. as different cans
attack you in different ways, they're the same as weapons for
you to use.
<br><br>
2020-02-02<br>
-guitar simulator for keyboard where you use the letters part (with
qwerty or whatever) for the strumming and the numpad for the chords.

the right chords? idk.<br>

change your hue. you have to keep up with the different patterns
the other rgb lights do.<br>
-game where you work together with a ai. the ai plays as the person
who does the platforming, and you do the level design. the ai isn't
the greatest, so you have to help it sometimes. though you could
flip it and have the ai be really good, giving the challenge of
having to defeat the ai. of course, making it so it's possible to
complete the level at all.
<br><br>
2020-02-01<br>
-(probably 3d) game where you design a ninja star. ninja stars will have 
multiple stats that the shape of the star will affect. maybe you can make 
multiple ninja stars, collect new metals, collect new tools and discover 
new throwiing techniques.<br>
-platformer game where things move to the beat. background music. maybe
you can mess around with the music? add effects? idk<br>

<br><br>
2020-01-31<br>
-fast-paced point-and-click game where it generates a random world. you
are a pizza delivery man and you have 2 minutes to deliver as many pizzas
as you can.<br>
^edit 2020-02-02: would probably be better as a 3d game.<br>
-you know those bags where the bag itself is attached with a zipper?
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GMpVX__0QQ) well the goal of the game
is to assemble/zip things up like that. kinda weird to explain, but
imagine zipping two long fabric things together, which makes a piece to
zip together with another thing and soon you get a dog. idk<br>
-game where you have to make a car by buying parts (parts are randomly
picked, you don't see all the parts). but the catch is you have 21
dollars. maybe have a ragdoll character when the car drives. like that
game Turbo Dismount.
<br><br>
2020-01-30<br>
-2d side scroller where you play as a tall creature. the creature has legs
on its head. it walks by flipping. think of it like someone doing a
handstand, and then going back to the feet. that's how the creature walks.
maybe the game could be a cool puzzle platformer? not sure.<br>
-game where people ask you for advice. they'll say a problem they have and
you give them an answer. as you play the game, you meet more and more
people. from random strangers to leaders of countries. and as you give
advice, you can see how your advice affected people and the world. since
this would be a word heavy game maybe use ai like gpt-2 or something.<br>
-game where you draw graphics which makes levels. at the start of the game
you need to draw a pencil to start drawing (idk). then you draw the ground
tiles, the player, and as you draw all these gameplay graphics the game
will generate levels based on your graphics. your run's graphics will be
made all by you, with the levels made indirectly by you.
<br><br>
2020-01-29<br>

have to make sure your shooting into the right socket, so canadians or
european. but there's also universal.
<br><br>
2020-01-28<br>
-relaxing game where each run generates random new elements, with random
reactions. your goal is to label and document elements and reactions.
perferably not just checking boxes of what the reaction does, more like
you actually have to write/type it down. perhaps a system can detect if
you're describing the reactions and if you do describe them correctly.<br>
-program that remaps your keyboard letters to different buttons everyday.
making it a game to use your computer for the day, having to figure out
what button is what letter. there could be a leaderboard of a streak of
how long they've been playing the game, each day figuring out what keys
are what.<br>
-game (probably on a site) that gives you points whenever you connect
to a new wifi network. basically a boring pokemon go but connecting to
wifi instead of catching cool and cute monsters.
<br><br>
2020-01-27<br>
-remember facade? that game where you can say whatever you want during
a couple going through issues? remake that game but use gpt-2. basically 
a game where you talk and have conversation using gpt-2.<br>
-game where the objective is to make a virus for a fake operating
system. the game has (or uses) a programming language. mess with the OS
and look for vulnerabilities.<br>
-any basic game (not the focus of the idea) that has an api to allow
making custom achievements. people can post achievements online, and
soon, the game becomes the game with the most achievements ever.

string extends towards your mouse cursor. so if you move your cursor
around a circle, the string will wrap around the circle.<br>
-shootemup game where your bullets bounce up and down. so if you shoot,
the bullet goes to the top of the screen, bounces down, hits the bottom
of the screen and bounces up and so forth. so you have to shoot but also
dodge your own bullets.
<br><br>
2020-01-25<br>
-real time board game. have timer that ticks every second.
players will make moves to the timer, of course allowing the
option to wait.<br>
-platformer or fps game where you can build up downward velocity.
this is like if you were programming gravity but never resetted it
so you keep just building velocity. basically a winded up ground 
pound.<br>
-based off of that driver game and clicked playing a pico-8 game
"only one enemy", platformer game where you can switch souls to
another entity. basically switching the camera and controls to
any entity.
<br><br>
2020-01-24<br>
-platformer game where you're like the blue shell powerup
in mario (not mario kart) except you're always a shell.<br>
-topdown (probably multiplayer) game where you have a sword
use the mouse to change the angle your player is facing. hit
the backside of the player with the sword.<br>
-1d (line back and forth) multiplayer game where you can go left
and right, you can switch from rock paper or scissors. goal is to
touch the other player with the winning move. either controls are
keyboard or mouse but mouse can go too fast.
<br><br>
2020-01-23<br>
-top down game where you shoot enemys with blue bullets. 
bullets bounce from enemys and switch to red which damage you. 
so you have to shoot enemys but dodge your own bullets as well.<br>
-top down shooting game where you can curb the bullet.<br>
-spin around and use jet to get around in no gravity<br>
^edit 2020-01-28: dunno how this is a game idea lol<br>
-guy goes back and forth and goes up while dodging holes. like 
icy tower.<br>
^edit 2020-01-28: basically imagine icy tower, but you always
move back and forth. the goal is to jump onto the higher platforms
while dodging holes.
