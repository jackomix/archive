My friend Nintel left Neocities, I decided that I would archive his site.
Now Neocities does have a archive system but they delete archives randomly without notice as they said so themselfs.

So I archived basically all of the last version of Nintel's site before he shut it down. Now he actually had his older site versions still on there so I don't have to do much work. Anyways, here it is.
