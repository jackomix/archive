<h2><b>I'm thinking of releasing Neopress...<span style="position: absolute;right: 30px;">2018-3-10</span></b></h2>
<p>Neocities is an amazing web host, however one of the things is that I get lazy when I work on my blog. To combat this I created a Python script to allow me to make blog posts faster. I made it actually a couple months ago but I never got around to releasing it, cuz I was  lazy. The script allows you to adapt to your own site and lets you use <b>HTML tags!</b> This blog post was made with Neopress by the way. :)</p>

<div id="blog">
<h2><b>Neopress bby!<span style="position: absolute;right: 30px;">2018-1-16</span></b></h2>
<p>It's going pretty well.</p>
</div>
<br>


<div id="blog">
<h2><b>This is an example of how Neopress can work with a styled site.<span style="position: absolute;right: 30px;">2018-1-16</span></b></h2>
<p>After setting the values to adapt to my site, I can now easily make blog posts in a breeze! I can also apply <b>HTML</b> code into my blog post.</p>
</div>

<div id="blog">
<h2><b>This is a test!<span style="position: absolute;right: 30px;">2018-1-16</span></b></h2>
<p>I hope it works!</p>

		<p>So it's going to be the new year. 2018 looks promising and i'm a bit excited to see what happens. This is probably gonna be a short blog post (though when I say that it becomes normal length) so I might just say that we got 20k views! Pretty cool for me, this site is doing way better than previous sites I had, I almost have 100 followers! I'm moving a bit on from websites though (i'll still update the blog don't worry), I just want to do stuff. I'll be in high school next year, after this schoolyear. I'll see the friends I have at this school and some old school friends I've used to see. Though it does a bit kinda worry me if they'd be the same, even after high school. Anyways this is the last day of 2017, gotta be positive! (I was right, the blog post is now at normal length lol.) Welp, I'll see ya next year, cya later guys! :D</p>
