      <a class="date" href="#2019-06-28"><b id="2019-06-28">2019-06-28</b></a> - i need to update the microblog more, as well as the blog. lol<br>
        <a class="date" href="#2019-05-31"><b id="2019-05-31">2019-05-31</b></a> - got an idea for a game. one that actually works btw! it's called famicart, you get a cartridge, which is a tiny game, play it, beat it, get coins and buy other cartridges. keep doing this till you collect them all!<br>
        <a class="date" href="#2019-05-30"><b id="2019-05-30">2019-05-30</b></a> - man, I haven't played it since I was little but Plants Vs Zombies is really fun. lol the first game is on mobile for free, with some iap/ads but you can just avoid them since it's just to cheat and stuff lol.<br>
        <a class="date" href="#2019-05-29"><b id="2019-05-29">2019-05-29</b></a> - the villain for jojo part 5 is really cool. fimished episode 27. kind of weird to have to wait to watch jojo when after part 5 i'll read the manga which goes up to part 8, which is still being written. also send me some cool chord progressions on my neocities page. shoutout to <a href="https://hosma.neocities.org">hosma</a> for putting cool chord progressions in his blog posts. :)<br>
        <a class="date" href="#2019-05-28"><b id="2019-05-28">2019-05-28</b></a> - turns out i suck cause i couldn't get pushing multiple blocks at once to work. after getting really fustrated about one part i realized everything i'd have to do and gave up. i might try again since i have another idea but i don't feel like doing it right now. also famicase's are really cool.<br>
        <a class="date" href="#2019-05-27"><b id="2019-05-27">2019-05-27</b></a> - got an idea for a game. top down sokoban like survival game. you push blocks into each other to craft stuff. so you could push a axe into a tree and you would get wood. gonna get on that as soon as i get home from school.<br>
        <a class="date" href="#2019-05-26"><b id="2019-05-26">2019-05-26</b></a> - for my culminating task in health class you need to answer a safety question. so i might do "how do hackers get passwords" though i wanna ask if i could do "how does password encryption work?". i also wanna make a video about it cause videos are cool.<br>
        <a class="date" href="#2019-05-25"><b id="2019-05-25">2019-05-25</b></a> - haven't played minecraft in years since xbox 360 but i got it on my switch and i'm having a blast!<br>
        <a class="date" href="#2019-05-24"><b id="2019-05-24">2019-05-24</b></a> - made a microblog, really fricking tiny blog posts. have fun! <a href="https://internetbee.neocities.org/">(credit to a. b. a fellow neomember for the background.)</p>
