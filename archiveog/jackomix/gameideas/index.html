# of game ideas: 375
<br><br>
2020-12-31<br>
-2d platformer game where you wake up and realize you only have 10 minutes until the world is destroyed. you have to do entries on your randomly generated to-do list in the sorta-big open world. like say hi to your neighboor, or jump on your bosses desk, get milk, etc. (last day)
<br><br>
2020-12-30<br>
-game where you are a giant boot that moves by jumping, and hopping. when you hop you do a full 360 degree flip. so you have to make sure to land everytime. when you crush something you bounce off of it too, like in mario. get to the goal of the levels. :) (crunch)
<br><br>
2020-12-29<br>
-walking simulator where you walk around a nice japanese styled town with a microphone. you can reocrd your footsteps, or put your microphone closer to objects to record their sounds more. like birds, wind rustling through trees, waterfalls, etc. then wheny ou get home you can use the samples you recorded in a nice music maker to make lofi beats. the game i guess would be a game with great sound design. (lofi)
<br><br>
2020-12-28<br>
-game that uses your mic and you have to see how long you can hold a note, both checking when you stop and also if you go off tune. maybe there's a mode where you can breathe out and get some air and return back to the note, but still checks if you're on pitch. this would be hard to do but i think would be a fun challenge (maybe have a delayed gate or something? idk). (om)
<br><br>
2020-12-27<br>
-game where you are presented a 16x16 picture that was scaled down to be 8x8. you are given a pallete, a 16x16 canvas, and 30 seconds (or a minute) to recreate the original sprite (you're only shown the 8x8 one). after the game will compare and show you the differences of yours and the true original. (scale)
<br><br>
2020-12-26<br>
-game where you are in a room with a vault and a door. you can't open the vault cause you don't know the password, so you go in the door. the door is locked from the outside though, and now you are stuck in the room the door led to. there is a note saying the password of the vault, and once you put it away, it vanishes forever. you use your phone and help is on the way in a year, in real life. so when you boot up the game after a real life year, then they open the door, and you can go to the vault, and if you remember the password from a year ago then you get to open the vault and win! (idk what the prize would be though) (also the password could be randomly generated so you actually have to remember it, and maybe it could be linked with your steam account if the game was one there so it stays when you switch pc's or something, unless you switch a steam account but whatever.) (and if you cheat, well then there's not point to the game then and you don't really feel any satisfaction from doing so.) (post)
<br><br>
2020-12-25<br>
-game like that tissue game where you try to get all the tissues out, you have to try to open all the layers of wrapping paper on a present. (christmas)
<br><br>
2020-12-24<br>
-game where you roll a ball of yarn and then you control the yarn, you have to try to get your rope around as many things as you can, without touching your rope or the obstacles (including the things you are trying to circle). (yarn)
<br><br>
2020-12-23<br>
-website where when you go on it or reload it picks a random number with the same odds as the lottery. if you win there'll be confetti, and it'll add to the text saying "X people have won the lottery!" (eve)
<br><br>
2020-12-22<br>
-game like minecraft. you start the game in a spaceship with other players, the games is rp based. you crashland into a random part of a huge planet, each region having random terrain and minerals, so each region looks really cool. you live your life as you explore other regions and meet other species. the game could also just be a minecraft modpack on a minecraft server. that could be fun if you actually got serious rp. (rp)
<br><br>
2020-12-21<br>
-fps game with warioware pace. you can pick up objects source engine style. you are given an objective on a tv screen as you are sitting in a room full of stuff. you have to do what it says in the short timer. so break a cup, or move the couch to the other side of the room, or gently turn your table and have all the stuff slide off of it without breaking. the game could have calming piano music playing from a radio, with a cozy atomosphere, and a relaxing tv thing, as you are stressing about holding cups and stuff. lol (do)
<br><br>
2020-12-20<br>
-roguelike but above ground so like overworld rpg. items are randomly generated with random stats, but also random enchantments. you can talk to people, who talk like they used tracery.io, then depending on how you talk (there can be options for how you respond, like being nice or an insult or whatever) and using the stats of the random npc determines how they will respond, so they might try to attack you if you hurt their feelings and they aren't afraid to hurt, or maybe halfway through they don't want to kill. maybe if you compliment them enough then their relationship threshold will be fuffiled and they'll give you a random present. monsters and dungeons are also randomly generated of course, but there are also structures in the overworld. the game generates a random world, with random key locations to help you on your randomly generated plot. things like the plot would probably be generated by something like tracery.io and parsed by the game. tracery kind of has its charm with procgen and also feeling the same, but it's different. idk, it's really weird but also cool, idk. (gen)
<br><br>
2020-12-19<br>
-rhythm heaven but with friends. you could have it so for example with two players, if it was like a game of catch, then it's not like each player presses it at the same time, but only when they catch it. so there could be some variety in there. idk. (march)
<br><br>
2020-12-18<br>
-chat program where you can only send a message to a contact per day. to make this a game idea include a streaks feature like snapchat. (break)
<br><br>
2020-12-17<br>
-game like clustertruck but with airplanes and a grappling hook. (fly)
<br><br>
2020-12-16<br>
-website where you register and gain access to a list of files hosted. okay so like, it's a file host. when you register, you have to upload one file per day or else your account gets deleted. when you're logged in, you get to see the hosted files by most recent. and you can only see the files of today, or maybe if your account was made 2 days ago, you'd also be able to see the history 2 days ago, though the only per day seems more easier to host, though maybe it should be forever but it's the just links that are toggled visiblity? idk. but it could be fun, and maybe a little weird. O_o (free)
<br><br>
2020-12-15<br>
-game where you swing hammers at targets by using your mouse first person to grab and throw them like you would in Garry's Mod with one of the physics guns. (hit)
<br><br>
2020-12-14<br>
-game like collab-vm and also parsec (so multiple people control it at the same time, maybe with different cursors for each player), perhaps one player tries to do something simple as the other players try to mess them up. and/or you have the ultimate game where a team of people try to protect the computer and a team of people try to destroy it. that would be pretty fun actually. i mean the collab-vm code is open source so it can be done. (game)
<br><br>
2020-12-13<br>
-game where you have to try to focus on something like a video and either there are artifical distractions or other players try to distract you. maybe this is like first person for the watcher and 3rd person for the distractor? idk. (squirrel)
<br><br>
2020-12-12<br>
-game where you are presented a sentence with a word that has different spellings, like "hay how are you", and the player picks if there's a misnomer word or not. so the example I gave with be wrong, so if you picked that you'd be right. the game would have a timer so you have to do this quickly and quicker as it progresses. stuff like "your welcome" and "their on their way" would show up too. (also "to", since I just mispelled too, lol.) (hey)
<br><br>
2020-12-11<br>
-fps fast paced game where you have a ball and you have to get to the goal. there are enemies. to kill them you must throw your ball at them, then the ball bounces off them into the air, and you have to get it throw it again. the game is supposed be sastifying and bonus if you add parkour. (this one i made up during the day and not when writing the idea yay) (throw at)
<br><br>
2020-12-10<br>
-game where you have to drift around in a busy city avoiding everyone. the gameplay is made so anyone can drift, and it feels really satisfying to do so. you do tight maneuvers and stuff while still being easy and feeling satisfying to play. (neotokyo)
<br><br>
2020-12-09<br>
-puzzle game where you assemble glass tube pieces to try to go around (have pieces make a loop around it or at least 270 degrees) maybe electrical balls that have static to them? and then you have to make the tubes all one loop. and when you do it the tubes fill up with the cool red neon and glows and shows the brick wall behind it with cool lighting and stuff. (fun fact penny's club was named after thinking about a neon sign like that.) (neon)
<br><br>
2020-12-08<br>
-relaxing (kind of) vr game where you are in a square, and surrounded by a whole bunch of stuff like hoops, slopes, tromplines etc. you stand in the middle square and have a ball you can throw. you can just mess around. maybe there could be tools to play with, like a counter or stopwatch, maybe even paint to coat the ball with traits (maybe even allowing stuff to happen on only one side of the ball, that could be cool, and even a game all on its own O_o). (baller)
<br><br>
2020-12-07<br>
-game where there is a random audience and you are given a characteristic and must count heads in 5 or 10 seconds. after it checks if you missed anything. this could be blonde people, people with hats, etc. the game would be nintendo-level polished with nice cute graphics. like thick black outlines and like a cartoon, coloured. (miscount)
<br><br>
2020-12-06<br>
-game where you are given a task to make a ui based off of something and are given an editor with elements and stuff. after you submit an ai determines how easy and good your ui is. maybe it could even give you the html and css code for it? idk. but either this could be pretty fun and neat, or actually useful if it goes ham, maybe even companies will use it. ooo. (design)
<br><br>
2020-12-05<br>
-game where it's a small application that is an infinite grid of pixels. everyday you can add 1 pixel from the pallete. as you live your life, your pixel art masterpiece will slowly be built, one pixel per day. (maybe every 10 days or month it can show what it was like back then, so you can look back on it.) (update)
<br><br>
2020-12-04<br>
-mobile game where the goal is to open the two sides of the curtains, and have the motions of your two fingers be the exact same. so someone will do the action, and the two fingers are mirrored, and it'll be all cool cause they got it. the game makes it really easy to try again. (curtain)
<br><br>
2020-12-03<br>
-party game where someone is given a prompt like "you see cheese" and someone writes what they do. then everyone else writes what happens next, and a random entry is chosen. then someone else gets a chance to say what they do next, this goes on until there's a chaotic adventure. (sandbox)
<br><br>
2020-12-02<br>
-game that's a program on your computer. it will randomly beep at you and play an alarm clock ringtone until you press the button to stop. it'll do this either none, once, or twice a day. but then, it slowly gets worse, appearing more often, and even making you do small challenge to turn it off. the goal of the game is to see how many days you can go with it on. it can easily be turned off or uninstalled, to make it clear it's not some virus. maybe there can be a leaderboard? it'd be cool but probably invite cheating. idk. (insanity)
<br><br>
2020-12-01<br>
-game where your cursor is a big block. hands the size of the block fly by the screen. your goal is to have as many as you can go across the screen, but you must block any high fives. the game calculates if the hand was gonna have a high-five, and awards you points if you blocked it. idk if there should be point subtraction, idk. (clap)
<br><br>
2020-11-30<br>
-3d 3rd person or 2d top down game, or 2d side scroller game where you do missions of stealing haybales from procedually generated farms. you can try to be sneaky, but if they catch you all the farmers will try to shoot you. (haybale hijackers)
<br><br>
2020-11-29<br>
-game where each player on their phone plays a mario-kart like game. at the end, all the ghosts (previous runs) are stacked, and could be fun for betting. this would be different as you wouldn't see your opponent, but still feel the rush to want to win. (rush)
<br><br>
2020-11-28<br>
-party game where players make lines for a rap, only knowing the last word said from the previous line/player. (weird)
<br><br>
2020-11-27<br>
-party game where players have to decide of a fact, dialogue, or whatever is fan fiction, or canon in some franchise. (fan fiction)
<br><br>
2020-11-26<br>
-horror game that uses your mic. if you scream, the threat get closer (or whatever), so you have to hold in any sounds you might make from getting scared. if this was paired with a good scary game, this would be a crazy experience. (scream)
<br><br>
2020-11-25<br>
-online game experiment where an entire universe is made (like worldbuilding) and has an encyclopedia on it. everyday there is a question about some random fact of the universe, like multiple choice, or short answer, whatever. you make an account that keeps track of your points, of the answers you get right and stuff. basically, you have to study the encyclopedia to get the questions right. maybe you get less points if you see the question, and *then* check the encyclopedia before answering, idk. but it could be cool, and maybe each "season" it would switch the universe, so maybe worldbuilders could get a spotlight or something. and maybe if their wolrd is popular enough, have a subdomain on the site just for their universe? idk. it could also be cool to get a random fact for someone's universe, if you prefer not to answer them and just look at the cool facts. maybe it could help with writer's block? idk. (think)
<br><br>
2020-11-24<br>
-website where you are asked basic moral questions, and you answer if that is morally wrong or not. at you answer the questions, the questions get harder and become more harder to answer moral and ethic questions. at the end of the test, you get to see the percentages forthe answers of each question. (bad)
<br><br>
2020-11-23<br>
-game similar to the presentation game and that one improv game. you and a friend are given an improv scenario, at a random moment, you press a button, and the computer (or phone, which would probably work best since it's hidden) will give you a random line. you have to say this line, and since it's random it'll be funny. maybe try not to laugh? idk, it might just be fun for everyone to laugh and have a good time. (laugh)
<br><br>
2020-11-22<br>
-party game where someone gets picked to be asked questions. the game tells the answerer if to lie or not for each question. the answerer makes their response and everyone votes on if they're lying or not. each person gets 5 questions. (it'd probably be best to have pre-written questions.) (question)
<br><br>
2020-11-21<br>
-game where you're a ball and you bounce around in the levels kind of like monogolf, you control the ball as it moves in air. your goal is to go into the cup that may be moving left and right to go to the next level. (ball & cup)
<br><br>
2020-11-20<br>
-game where you try to teach a small deep learning ai by telling if it is right or wrong about something. like if the question was "is this odd or even", then the ai makes its answer and you tell it if it's wrong or right. you could say the ai is right when it's wrong, and it would then be flipped. you could also do digit recongition. and maybe custom questions, with the ai giving broad answers, like text (though that's hard) or drawings, or choices, idk. just teaching the ai something would be cool. (coach)
<br><br>
2020-11-19<br>
-game where you look at clouds, and you look at a specific reigon of them and label them something that they look like. you keep a collection of them, and can export as an html file to show to your friends! it's supposed to be realxing, has sunet modes and stuff, and could also be a music player. it's just something you'd use normally, and build your cloud collection as you use it. (sky)
<br><br>
2020-11-18<br>
-game where each person takes a turn writing a comic panel, except you only get to see a random quarter-square of the last panel, so you barely know what's going on. after this a chaotic comic will have been made. (video)
<br><br>
2020-11-17<br>
-game where you are given 5 seconds to guess if a calculation was done right, like 1 + 1 = 2, or 50 / 25 = 3, as you gain score, the questions get harder and harder. (calculator)
<br><br>
2020-11-16<br>
-clicker game, but you can buy upgrades and 'buildings' on ebay with an auction. either there are ai bidders, or real players bidding. maybe both? the ai when the game isn't as popular? idk. sounds cool though, and could be fun, and maybe addicting? :/ (ebay)
<br><br>
2020-11-15<br>
-physics toy where you can draw walls and rain. you can change the brush size (if it's with rain it'll just make more rain drops, not a bigger mass of water) and watch the rain flood or do whatever. you could have it so it wraps around vertically, so you can have infinite rain falling. (storm)
<br><br>
2020-11-14<br>
-game where you are shown a colouring book page for one second and then it goes away. you have to try to colour the page, remembering what the black outline was like. at the end it puts back on the black outline and you get to see how it looks. (color)
<br><br>
2020-11-13<br>
-game where to get to the goal in a platformer level you must configure every entity like you would configure a synthizier. this includes springs, the player, enemies, even the goal itself. (synth)
<br><br>
2020-11-12<br>
-vr game where you press a button, and you are put in a random scenario with someone. you must act along with that person. then once you're done you can save it and move on. however, your performance is still there, and someone might load into that scene with you and act along side you. the cycle continues, and community theatre in vr is made. (act)
<br><br>
2020-11-11<br>
-3d vr game where you're a barber shop. you are given a hairstyle to do and must use weird objects like barbed wire and such to cut the hair into that style. there can also be weird substances for it like acid or whatever. (barb)
<br><br>
2020-11-10<br>
-mobile game where you tilt your phone to surf. the tracks are like that 3d sonic minigame or those marble race half tubes or whatever. maybe they could be bigger or something idk. probably an open world game like the island in wii sports resort would probably be better and cooler, idk. (spiral)
<br><br>
2020-11-09<br>
-game where you have a whole bunch of 3d shapes and a 3d box dash border thingy. the goal is to assemble the 3d objects together to make the cube that goes with that white dash outline border thing making up the cube. the camera rotates around the dash cube and you can rotate by dragging around and stuff. the background is blured and has white objects, maybe like a location like a kitchen and everything is no texture and just white. the game would be relaxing. the 3d shapes would look rounded and very reflecty and glossy. they'd also be basic colours like red and stuff. maybe in the later levels the background is black and there's cyan for the shapes and stuff, idk. (cube)
<br><br>
2020-11-08<br>
-tower defense game where bad guys try to get from one side of a bath to the other (horizontally), you have to use special shampoo, bubble-stuff, and the quanitites of the liquids (that you earn from playing the game) to spawn bubbles and other stuff to fight the bad guys. maybe the bad guys can be germs or something idk. (bath)
<br><br>
2020-11-07<br>
-game where cookie dough is spinning and you drop chocolate chips. you have to try to time it just right so there's an equal amount of distances between the chips. you find this out when the cookie is in the oven and hardens. (chippy)
<br><br>
2020-11-06<br>
-multiplayer fps hide and seek game with your friends except when you hide you try to sleep, it takes you a minute to sleep. the game could be creepy as the seeker almost finds you as you're close to falling asleep. idk. (tired)
<br><br>
2020-11-05<br>
-online web game where people can draw roads, and also make signs with drawings (which would be icons or street signs) on them. you can also drive around. i guess it would be best if you could add houses, trees, water and stuff too. (icon)
<br><br>
2020-11-04<br>
-online web game where you fly an airplane. when you crash, the wreckage stays there for other players to see. the wreckage also has collisions. the game is an experiment to see what the result would look like. (exploration)
<br><br>
2020-11-03<br>
-typeracer but instead of retyping text, you're listening to audio and typing what they say. there are multiple stats, accuracy, grammar, etc. (write)
<br><br>
2020-11-02<br>
-game where you play with hoses, gears, pumps, etc to try to make power from water. (hydro)
<br><br>
2020-11-01<br>
-side scroller platformer game where your hand is in a karate chop position and always faces your cursor from the player. you chop enemies, walls floors and etc to get to the goal. (chop)
<br><br>
2020-10-31<br>
-fast paced game where you open your door and either it is real monsters or kids in costumes, you have to give candy to the kids, and pass the monsters. i could imagine after a lot of practice it'd look cool as you quickly go through each thing. maybe you could also have buttons for quanitites, so if there's half kids half monsters, then hit the button to only give half, so it's three buttons, give candy, give half, pass. though that'd be in the later parts, maybe levels? idk. also happy halloween! :) (candy)
<br><br>
2020-10-30<br>
-game where you make lamps on a site and people vote on their favourite lamps. there are leaderboards for best lamp of the minute, hour, day, week, month, year, decade, and all time. idk if you draw the lamp or if you use an editor. i guess drawing the lamp would be best. (lamp)
<br><br>
2020-10-29<br>
-game where it shows a product, its price, what it is, its stats on how well it does, etc. the point of the game is to have it go on sale with a 1-100% discount. the game already knows the best discount, and you have to try to get as close to it as you can. so the goal is to try to determine the best discount to get the most profit. probably a web game and similar to that kerning game, with the ui and such. idk. (sale)
<br><br>
2020-10-28<br>
-game where you join groups. you go on google street view and go around the world. as you explore it will track where you went, thus as the group walks around random places you start to "take over" land. you could have it so you always continue where you left off, and maybe having bookmarks if you like a place (to open in actual google maps). the game would have a leaderboard with the most traveled distance of groups. the groups themselves could also have leaderboards of the most travelling users. maybe there could be regions for the site, or maybe even allow have it so if you go to an airport, the game will try to check where the airport can fly to, and can take you there. maybe to fly you'll have to wait a day or two, or maybe even a week. idk. it sounds cool though and i think it'd be relaxing. (tribe)
<br><br>
2020-10-27<br>
-game where a random photo is generated of blobs of colours, you have to pick which colours takes up most space. you have a timer to do it that gets shorter as you higher up your score. the colours' quantitys also look more similar as the game goes on. (colour)
<br><br>
2020-10-26<br>
-leap frog but it's multiplayer mouse cursors with friends (each cursor a different colour). (frog)
<br><br>
2020-10-25<br>
-io game where you play as a man who can land on planets with his rocket. your player can get guns and grab loot from small planets in the space map. if you die, people can find your stuff and take it. the game is top-down and has a bold outline cartoony doodley? style. (rocket)
<br><br>
2020-10-24<br>
-game where you break peanuts by smashing them with a hammer by pressing the keyboard key that is the area. so q will be in the top left of the screen, since it's the top left of the keyboard. (nut)
<br><br>
2020-10-23<br>
-virtual game where you control an avatar and do improv games with your friends. there are props and stuff. i guess games like garry's mod would be good for this, but it feels rough, and doesn't allow much expression without commands or something. there could also be set walls, like doors or whatever. (door)
<br><br>
2020-10-22<br>
-game where you keep on scrolling down a infinite picture of a building. you keep going until you stop at the picture you were giving at the start. you can see your max speed, which is your high score. there are other pictures on the building. the placement of the picture is randomizd. the scroll may or may not be smooth to get that feel for speed, though it could backfire., idk. (scroll)
<br><br>
2020-10-21<br>
-game like getting over it but you're trying to dig to treasure with a shovel. idk if the shovel is attatch to a body or something but it would be hard to control. maybe like, around the handle your cursor? idk. (chuck)
<br><br>
2020-10-20<br>
-game where stamps of different letters scroll across a paper. click to stamp the one in the middle. the paper then moves a bit like a typewriter. the goal is to write something with every word being an actual word. bonus points if you make this a party game where each player takes a turn clicking. (press)
<br><br>
2020-10-19<br>
-game where you walk around a in game city. you are given a sound and have to recreate that sound in the city since your player is holding a microphone. you can walk around and also move your arm and microphone to put it in front of a speaker or something. once you submit your submit, it'll check how close it is. and give you a score and/or percentage, idk. (microphone)
<br><br>
2020-10-18<br>

-game where things are scattered across the screen. you have to
drag everything into it's right box. the box could sort from
colour, to the starting letter of it's word, or even to what
scientific element occurs the most in it. (perhaps you could
have a inspector to get stats about objects.) idk.
<br><br>
2020-03-27<br>
-game where you are stuck in your office with a few things. your
goal is to play the game in one sitting for 3 hours. you have to
occupy yourself by messing around with the enviorment, without
making a distraction. the game will check if you're actually
playing it as well. there should be only things that you can play
with for a bit but you couldn't have too much fun and do all the
way through. things can interact with each other though, so the
game initiates you to be creative. things can be stuff like tape,
staples, paper and pencil, a computer, and etc.
<br><br>

<br><br>
2020-03-20<br>
-platformer where you play as a car. the controls are as if it
was a top down racing game, however gravity fights you. so you
get these weird controls that should seem kinda cool. idk.
<br><br>
2020-03-19<br>
-vr game where you play as cartoony bodies. (think of a spoon
but more circular and with arms and legs.) the goal is to tag
each other to kill each other. but you can upgrade stats
like movement speed and arm length. maybe you level up those
from matches or get powerups or both. you can customize
your character greatly. although they'll like silly and can

this game and had a lot of laughs. rip me. idk.
<br><br>

2020-03-17<br>
-not really a game idea but... the game board is a keyboard.

<br><br>
2020-03-10<br>
-game to learn about sound fx. there's a speaker that
goes to different locations in each level. you have to enable
the right fx that would fit. for example if a speaker was in
a church, you would put a reverb effect. though it can get
weird. if the speaker is in a room where the walls are mirrors,
you might have to put a chorus effect. idk.
<br><br>
2020-03-09<br>
-game where two players control one character at a time.
one player tries to keep the character alive, the other
tries to kill the character. the twist is that each

-game where you make video advertisements for companies.
<br><br>
2020-03-07<br>
-game where as you explore the world, you can name the colours.

-game where you explore a town or city. you might be at the
right place at the right time, and something will happen.
you write about this in the newspaper you work on. the goal
of the game is to document the most events you can. the
game detects what event you're talking about and what detail.
<br><br>
2020-03-02<br>
-game where you are placed in a randomly generated world. the
game's terrain is wavy, but the camera is still stableized on
the player. so the player could do a loopy loop but it kinda
seems like a flat plane. you have to find your way out (to the
next level) by talking to people. as you explore the random
world, you learn about it. this would be a very relaxing game.
there could be a story, but i'd like at least a mode that is
just a world one after another.
<br><br>
2020-03-01<br>
-game where you look at a neighborhood, you connect the wires
to the houses. however, stuff like limited electricity and
limited supply of wires require you to think carefully. it's
a puzzle game on how to connect each house with a wire
together.
<br><br>
2020-02-29<br>

center and around the arena are powerups like a gap powerup
that stops you making a trail for a bit, creating a gap.
there's speed boosts, radars that check for nearby players
for 30 seconds and so forth. the game could have 5 up to
500 players as ai. (i always love games where you can add
a lot of ai players like armagetron advanced.)
<br><br>
2020-02-26<br>
-game where you control a radio, you can only turn the
station knob. the game is a big story, could be about
a DJ or some random dude asking for help in a
post-apocalyptic world. idk. 
<br><br>
2020-02-25<br>
-game where you tie your shoes. you move the left string,
which mirrors on the right (but flipped vertically). at
first you can tie your shoes normally but then there are
obstacles like spikes that get in your way. there could
also be stuff to manipulate the laces, providing more
methods and obstacles. idk. 
<br><br>
2020-02-24<br>
-game where the player makes up a random gesture, which
generates an action based on that gesture. like if the player
swipes up, the player would jump. if the player does a zig-zag
then something will happen. the actions from the gesture are
not pre-programmed, they are generated. idk.
<br><br>
2020-02-23 (ayy)<br>

eyes, making the screen go black. you are still when your
eyes are open.
<br><br>
2020-02-22<br>
-game where you are given random pictures. the pictures are
weird creatures you've never seen before. you have to
classify them as A or B (there'll be random names). when you
guess, you will be told if you are right. you have to figure
out what creatures are which. the game gets harder and harder
adding more options, breeds to creatures, transformations to
the image and so on.
<br><br>
2020-02-21<br>
-game where you spam the space. you have to get to exactly
party 100 in the shortest time possible. when you think you 
got 100 then press enter or something. if you didn't get
100 then you lose. so you have to spam the button exactly
100 times, and then submit your number as fast as you can.
idk.<br>
^edit 2020-02-22: you can make the game more difficult by
not allowing the player to see how many times they've
clicked.
<br><br>
2020-02-20<br>
-game where it presents a pattern with shapes. you have
to get the pattern right and move to the next one. you have

"it goes square then circle then repeat") idk.
<br><br>
2020-02-19<br>
-game where you switch bodies with an alien from another

without crossing your trail. 
<br><br>
2020-02-11<br>
-top down game where you survive in a procedural-generated
world. items are pushed like blocks in sokoban. push an axe
into a tree to cut it down. create entire rooms full with
items. there was a switch game i think was about sorting
a warehouse with this similar concept, (i came up with the
idea before i saw the game tho) the art style looks cool.
so maybe something like that? (not roguelike style though,
have more colour and stuff.)
<br><br>
2020-02-10<br>
-game where you have to do impressions of voices/characters.
bot or ai will detect how close you are to the real voice and

<br><br>
2020-02-09<br>
-game like papers please where you do taxes for aliens. you

of course, like papers please there could be a story about
tax evasion. (yoshi no!)
<br><br>
2020-02-08<br>

angry. you have to make it angry for it to let out all the
rage and shoot. not sure how you can make it angry though.<br>
-maybe 3d, fps or point and click game where you are in
different scenarios. you are really tired and you want to go
to bed. you have to go to bed as fast as you can, while not

as you try to go as fast as possible.
<br><br>
2020-02-07<br>

get some more game ideas tommorow or something.)
<br><br>
2020-02-06<br>

same time, and then another person calls. see where i'm going
with this? help mulitple people on the phone at once.<br>
-game where you have to skip rope yourself. there's three
characters, the edges holding the rope. click and drag on them
spinning in circles for them to turn their arm. then drag the

or you're too slow then you lose.<br>
-anonimity (for tommorow)
<br><br>
2020-02-04<br>
-this is gonna be a confusing one. 3d game where you play inside 
of a sphere. your goal is to hit the ball so it stays above the 
ground, like in volleyball. when you hit the ball into the air,
the sphere kinda goes inside out and shows the opponent. this is
probably a idea you would need to flesh out but it seems cool.<br>
-adventurer mode from dwarf fortress. except the history has
three stages, historic, present and future. your character can do
whatever they want in the world. and if they are able to use a
time machine, go to one of the three time periods and explore.
<br><br>
2020-02-03<br>
-game where you shoot cans by throwing cans that you have knocked

you to use.
<br><br>
2020-02-02<br>

change your hue. you have to keep up with the different patterns
the other rgb lights do.<br>
-game where you work together with a ai. the ai plays as the person
who does the platforming, and you do the level design. the ai isn't
the greatest, so you have to help it sometimes. though you could
flip it and have the ai be really good, giving the challenge of
having to defeat the ai. of course, making it so it's possible to
complete the level at all.
<br><br>
2020-02-01<br>

<br><br>
2020-01-31<br>
-fast-paced point-and-click game where it generates a random world. you
are a pizza delivery man and you have 2 minutes to deliver as many pizzas
as you can.<br>
^edit 2020-02-02: would probably be better as a 3d game.<br>
-you know those bags where the bag itself is attached with a zipper?
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GMpVX__0QQ) well the goal of the game
is to assemble/zip things up like that. kinda weird to explain, but
imagine zipping two long fabric things together, which makes a piece to
zip together with another thing and soon you get a dog. idk<br>

game Turbo Dismount.
<br><br>
2020-01-30<br>
-2d side scroller where you play as a tall creature. the creature has legs
on its head. it walks by flipping. think of it like someone doing a
handstand, and then going back to the feet. that's how the creature walks.
maybe the game could be a cool puzzle platformer? not sure.<br>
-game where people ask you for advice. they'll say a problem they have and
you give them an answer. as you play the game, you meet more and more
people. from random strangers to leaders of countries. and as you give
advice, you can see how your advice affected people and the world. since
this would be a word heavy game maybe use ai like gpt-2 or something.<br>
-game where you draw graphics which makes levels. at the start of the game
you need to draw a pencil to start drawing (idk). then you draw the ground
tiles, the player, and as you draw all these gameplay graphics the game

made all by you, with the levels made indirectly by you.
<br><br>

<br><br>
2020-01-28<br>
-relaxing game where each run generates random new elements, with random
reactions. your goal is to label and document elements and reactions.
perferably not just checking boxes of what the reaction does, more like
you actually have to write/type it down. perhaps a system can detect if
you're describing the reactions and if you do describe them correctly.<br>
-program that remaps your keyboard letters to different buttons everyday.
making it a game to use your computer for the day, having to figure out
what button is what letter. there could be a leaderboard of a streak of
how long they've been playing the game, each day figuring out what keys
are what.<br>
-game (probably on a site) that gives you points whenever you connect
to a new wifi network. basically a boring pokemon go but connecting to
wifi instead of catching cool and cute monsters.
<br><br>
2020-01-27<br>
-remember facade? that game where you can say whatever you want during
a couple going through issues? remake that game but use gpt-2. basically

-game where the objective is to make a virus for a fake operating
system. the game has (or uses) a programming language. mess with the OS
and look for vulnerabilities.<br>

string extends towards your mouse cursor. so if you move your cursor
around a circle, the string will wrap around the circle.<br>
-shootemup game where your bullets bounce up and down. so if you shoot,
the bullet goes to the top of the screen, bounces down, hits the bottom
of the screen and bounces up and so forth. so you have to shoot but also
dodge your own bullets.
<br><br>
2020-01-25<br>
-real time board game. have timer that ticks every second.
players will make moves to the timer, of course allowing the
option to wait.<br>
-platformer or fps game where you can build up downward velocity.
this is like if you were programming gravity but never resetted it
so you keep just building velocity. basically a winded up ground 
pound.<br>
-based off of that driver game and clicked playing a pico-8 game
"only one enemy", platformer game where you can switch souls to
another entity. basically switching the camera and controls to
any entity.
<br><br>
2020-01-24<br>
-platformer game where you're like the blue shell powerup
in mario (not mario kart) except you're always a shell.<br>

use the mouse to change the angle your player is facing. hit
the backside of the player with the sword.<br>
-1d (line back and forth) multiplayer game where you can go left
and right, you can switch from rock paper or scissors. goal is to
touch the other player with the winning move. either controls are
keyboard or mouse but mouse can go too fast.
<br><br>
2020-01-23<br>
-top down game where you shoot enemys with blue bullets. 
bullets bounce from enemys and switch to red which damage you. 
so you have to shoot enemys but dodge your own bullets as well.<br>
-top down shooting game where you can curb the bullet.<br>
-spin around and use jet to get around in no gravity<br>
^edit 2020-01-28: dunno how this is a game idea lol<br>
-guy goes back and forth and goes up while dodging holes. like 
icy tower.<br>
^edit 2020-01-28: basically imagine icy tower, but you always
move back and forth. the goal is to jump onto the higher platforms
while dodging holes.
