        <p>This is a box that has contents in it. These contents may be a project link, a blog post, or whatever. This site however will be full of these boxes, so the site will just have random content all over the screen, which I think would be sick to look at. This was inspired by joppiesaus' website since they do the same thing, but for more random things rather than taking the personal site template and doing it to it. i'll also try to design it similar to novov and marijn, since they have colorful but modern designs that look so sick.</p>
