    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Back then, there used to be a website called Geocities! You could create websites for free and a whole bunch of people made some! They looked horrible but they had their charm. But then Geocities closed down. (execpt for Japan.) Until later some people made a cool website called Neocities! Then people made websites like the old Geocities websites and this website is one of them! :D So yeah. :)</p>
