    <h3>Updated the Discord server!</h3>
    <p>You guy's might not have noticed this but i have a Neocities discord server! But i kinda rushed it. :p But last night i decided to update it! I put only 1 bot in it, i changed the logo, i changed the name, i removed a channel that wasn't needed, i got a bot to autorole and i even changed the name! I updated it because it seems that Openbooks Lounge closed down, and sc's house isn't really about Neocities so i decided, imma update my Neocities discord server! To go and visit just simply go into my sidebar and click on "Discord", i hope you guys enjoy! :D (Also be sure to put your ideas and suggestions for my website in the guestbook!!!)</p>

    <h3>Where have i been? [3:52 2016-09-24]</h3>
    <p>Where have i been exactly? Well i have been active but i am getting pretty lazy on this website and considering on giving up on it. It's been fun and all but nobody really gives me feedback and when they do it's just one guy. So if you do like my website and want me to keep it running and want me to make 3.0 (which was in the making) then give me some suggestions in my guestbook. School has also been in the way and my sleep schedule is falling apart. So yeah, Buh-Bye! :D</p>
    <p class="double"></p>
    <h3>Tommorow's school. :o [10:54 2016-9-5]</h3>
    <p>Tommorow is school and i am a nervous because i am going to an new school due to the other one being closed down. My friends from the other school will be there though. Including my kindergarden friends! :D And because of this i might be less active. :p But remember to post your suggestions for this website in my guestbook! :D Buh-Bye! :D</p>

Including the Back To The Future trilogy! :D My sister let me get some movies and as soon as i saw the trilogy i got it. I always wanted to watch the trilogy because everybody was talking about it on 2015. Anyways, i know i haven't updated the website but i been really busy lately. But i am working on Mebi Studios! I just am not updating the site because you guys never really use my guestbook to do stuff that would help me. But i'm thinking of updating the site when i have time. Anyways Buh-Bye! :D</p>

And i have been also thinking about upgrading to 3.0! :D But because i have no idea what you guys want i would <b>REALLY</b> like it if you told me what you wanna see via my guestbook and/or my neocites profile page! I am also working on things to put on the download section! :) Also i made it to the front page! :D Just scroll down and there i am! :) I really enjoy the support you guys have been giving me and i want to become one with the future!

    <p>So you guys likely never asked these questions but guess what! I don't care! :D So imma answer some questions you may have about the website and maybe even me directly! :D</p>
    <p>Q:Are you a boy or girl? A:I am a boy! :D</p>
    <p>Q:Why the new website change? A:Well because i saw some other websites and wanted my own. But i still wanted to keep up this site. So i just updated the site! And because i am not great at html it's kinda like Geocities mixed with Modern! :D</p>
    <p>Q:How can i contact you? A:Well this website is hosted on Neocities, and whats awesome is that each website has a profile, meaning you can comment and follow and other stuff! :D So if you wanna contact me you can sign up on Neocities and go and click the Contact button on my sidemenu and comment! :D I also post updates on there and if i forget to tell you guys Neocities does it automatically! :D</p>
    <p>Q:I followed you, does something happen now? A:Well i guess not really. :/ But it's kinda like Subcribe on YouTube. You can see my comments on my Neocities profile and see when updates happen. Maybe at some point ill make the follow system come up to use at this website but for now. No. :/</p>
