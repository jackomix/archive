    <h1>Terms</h1>
    I decided I will come up with terms that will be able to explain things easier.
    <br><br>
    <b>Techniground</b> - A Techniground is an object that is Technically Ground, in that it lets Mario stand on it like regular ground.
    <br>
    <b>CDJ</b> - Cappy Dive Jump, when you do that thing where you get a bounce from throwing Cappy and diving into him.
