    <h1>Jacklack3's Super Mario Odyssey Page!</h1>
    SMO is one of my favourite games, however I thought it would be cool to have a page with info about cool stuff. This is it! I kinda want to just have the information be public instead of spending like an hour working on the style of the site so if anyone want's to make a CSS file for me then please do!
