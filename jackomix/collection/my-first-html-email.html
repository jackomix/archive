  <p>On <time>April 24, 2019, 2AM (local time)</time>, 
  I <del>composed</del> gave birth to an incredibly witty 
  and handsome young email, named "my first html email (test)". 
  <p>We attempted to send <del>the email</del> my child through gmail using 
  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsMSqhMlfao'>this youtube guide</a> 
  as part of a daring experiment. 
  sadly, skippy did not make it, and died on delivery.
  <p>I have painted from memory this incredibly vivid portrait of him. 
  RIP in peace, son <span role='img' aria-label='mournful face'>ðŸ˜”</span>
