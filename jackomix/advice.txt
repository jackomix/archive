- confidence is really key. you could trip the dumbest way but if you're confident people would probably laugh with you, rather than at you.
- if you mess up speaking, don't call it out. it becomes really awkward. you can call it out if you keep messing up a lot or someone else calls out on it. if you do say something say "i can't talk today" cause it isn't as awkward than saying something.
- if you're a teenager with teenage friends, telling them about a crush is risky, either it'll be fine or turn into an inside joke and not be taken seriously.
- take your own advice.
