least amount of damage.

-game where you play against another player. you tap a drum to a song, then after 2 bars
you then hear each others beats. the goal is to me the most on tempo, you can try to

it can mess up your accuracy, or even mess you up in the process.

-game where you run away from your shadow that follows you. casting light will make
shadows that follow you as well.

2020-05-20
-web game that displays a counter. the goal is for the counter to go to a million. if you
click add, it will add for everyone who is or will view the site, and the same if you
click subtract (but subtract instead of add). if the counter goes to negative a million,
then you lose. it'd be interesting to see who wins, the adders, or the subtracters...

2020-05-19
-fps game with two teams. each player has a health bar, if you shoot a player, you gain
a bit of HP. at the end of the game the team with the most hp on all members total wins.

idea so don't steal it please lol)

-party game where each person takes a turn being the host. an object is given to the
rest, like a car or something, then players are supposed to make the other side of the

making a distraction. the game will check if you're actually
playing it as well. there should be only things that you can play
with for a bit but you couldn't have too much fun and do all the

-platformer where you play as a car. the controls are as if it
was a top down racing game, however gravity fights you. so you
get these weird controls that should seem kinda cool. idk.

2020-03-19
-vr game where you play as cartoony bodies. (think of a spoon
but more circular and with arms and legs.) the goal is to tag
each other to kill each other. but you can upgrade stats
like movement speed and arm length. maybe you level up those

this game and had a lot of laughs. rip me. idk.

goes to different locations in each level. you have to enable
the right fx that would fit. for example if a speaker was in

weird. if the speaker is in a room where the walls are mirrors,
you might have to put a chorus effect. idk.

2020-03-09
-game where two players control one character at a time.
one player tries to keep the character alive, the other

2020-03-07

-game where you explore a town or city. you might be at the
right place at the right time, and something will happen.
you write about this in the newspaper you work on. the goal
of the game is to document the most events you can. the
game detects what event you're talking about and what detail.

2020-03-02
-game where you are placed in a randomly generated world. the
game's terrain is wavy, but the camera is still stableized on
the player. so the player could do a loopy loop but it kinda
seems like a flat plane. you have to find your way out (to the
next level) by talking to people. as you explore the random
world, you learn about it. this would be a very relaxing game.
there could be a story, but i'd like at least a mode that is
just a world one after another.

2020-03-01
-game where you look at a neighborhood, you connect the wires
to the houses. however, stuff like limited electricity and
limited supply of wires require you to think carefully. it's
a puzzle game on how to connect each house with a wire
together.

2020-02-29
-game where you manage a buttercup (like reese's). you have

you for commands. you have to befriend the people to get them
to do what you want.

2020-02-27
-tron but in the format of minecraft hunger games. in the
center and around the arena are powerups like a gap powerup
that stops you making a trail for a bit, creating a gap.
there's speed boosts, radars that check for nearby players
for 30 seconds and so forth. the game could have 5 up to
500 players as ai. (i always love games where you can add
a lot of ai players like armagetron advanced.)

2020-02-26
-game where you control a radio, you can only turn the
station knob. the game is a big story, could be about
a DJ or some random dude asking for help in a
post-apocalyptic world. idk. 

2020-02-25
-game where you tie your shoes. you move the left string,
which mirrors on the right (but flipped vertically). at
first you can tie your shoes normally but then there are
obstacles like spikes that get in your way. there could
also be stuff to manipulate the laces, providing more
methods and obstacles. idk. 

2020-02-24
-game where the player makes up a random gesture, which
generates an action based on that gesture. like if the player
swipes up, the player would jump. if the player does a zig-zag
then something will happen. the actions from the gesture are
not pre-programmed, they are generated. idk.

2020-02-23 (ayy)
-platformer game where you can only move when you close your
eyes, making the screen go black. you are still when your
eyes are open.

2020-02-22
-game where you are given random pictures. the pictures are
weird creatures you've never seen before. you have to
classify them as A or B (there'll be random names). when you
guess, you will be told if you are right. you have to figure
out what creatures are which. the game gets harder and harder
adding more options, breeds to creatures, transformations to
the image and so on.

2020-02-21
-game where you spam the space. you have to get to exactly
party 100 in the shortest time possible. when you think you 
got 100 then press enter or something. if you didn't get
100 then you lose. so you have to spam the button exactly
100 times, and then submit your number as fast as you can.
idk.
^edit 2020-02-22: you can make the game more difficult by
not allowing the player to see how many times they've
clicked.

2020-02-20
-game where it presents a pattern with shapes. you have
to get the pattern right and move to the next one. you have
to do these fast, cause there's a timer. if the timer runs
out or you get the pattern wrong, you lose. (stuff like,
"it goes square then circle then repeat") idk.

2020-02-19
-game where you switch bodies with an alien from another
world. you have to get used to their school system, jobs,
social norms and etc. thinking visual novel. could also be
some cool message about our currenty society. idk.

you use the mouse to drag each limb, so the forearm, the
upperleg, wrists, etc.

putting it in a recycle bin. the items can be recycled into
tools to pick up litter faster.

2020-02-16

sky is white. you have a gun that can shoot the sky to add
blue. use the mouse to aim. enemies will try to stop you.

2020-02-15
-3d 3rd person game where you walk in a city. you can cough
on people, making them sick and make them controllable as
well. the goal of the game is to get the entire city
populated. kinda like katamari.

2020-02-14
-game where two players are on a spinning converyor belt.
each player basically pulls each other to punch. so instead
of your first going to your opponent, you're making your
opponent go to your fist. idk.

2020-02-13
-game where you are the guest on a talk show. it's a cyoa
style of game. there's different endings, from you bombiing
the interview, to you becoming the host. idk.

2020-02-12
-game like tron but you move your mouse. as you move your
mouse, it makes a trail. you have eat food (like snake)
without crossing your trail. 

2020-02-11
-top down game where you survive in a procedural-generated
world. items are pushed like blocks in sokoban. push an axe
into a tree to cut it down. create entire rooms full with
items. there was a switch game i think was about sorting
a warehouse with this similar concept, (i came up with the
idea before i saw the game tho) the art style looks cool.
so maybe something like that? (not roguelike style though,
have more colour and stuff.)

2020-02-10
-game where you have to do impressions of voices/characters.
bot or ai will detect how close you are to the real voice and
give you a score/rating. maybe do the mean or do like how
cubers do it and remove best and worst score and then do the
mean? idk.

2020-02-09
-game like papers please where you do taxes for aliens. you
go to different planets which have different tax systems.
of course, like papers please there could be a story about
tax evasion. (yoshi no!)

2020-02-08
-platformer where you can only move horizontally if you jump.
this is like playing a mario game but always crouching.
-game where you have a gun, the gun is alive, and also gets
angry. you have to make it angry for it to let out all the
rage and shoot. not sure how you can make it angry though.
-maybe 3d, fps or point and click game where you are in
different scenarios. you are really tired and you want to go
to bed. you have to go to bed as fast as you can, while not
doing hard tasks that make you sleep. so maybe go from work
to your bed, having to decide if you should do something or
a different thing and which will not make you more tired,
as you try to go as fast as possible.

2020-02-07
-game where you aim the sun towards the moon to make the light
bounce onto the earth. maybe later you have to move the moon
and sun, as well as their rotation. maybe they have a shield
which covers up half of it or something.
(sorry for the lack of game ideas each day btw, i'll try to
get some more game ideas tommorow or something.)

2020-02-06
-game where there are numerous anonymous groups, the only lead
is their mask. you have to find these groups in a city.

2020-02-05
-game where you are work for customer service for a technology
company. you get a call, pick up, and start helping the person.
when suddenly, another person calls, you talk to both at the
same time, and then another person calls. see where i'm going
with this? help mulitple people on the phone at once.
-game where you have to skip rope yourself. there's three
characters, the edges holding the rope. click and drag on them
spinning in circles for them to turn their arm. then drag the
middle guy up to make him jump. so you have to make the two
edge guys spin the rope and jump over it. if the rope hits you
or you're too slow then you lose.
-anonimity (for tommorow)

2020-02-04
-this is gonna be a confusing one. 3d game where you play inside 
of a sphere. your goal is to hit the ball so it stays above the 
ground, like in volleyball. when you hit the ball into the air,
the sphere kinda goes inside out and shows the opponent. this is
probably a idea you would need to flesh out but it seems cool.
-adventurer mode from dwarf fortress. except the history has
three stages, historic, present and future. your character can do
whatever they want in the world. and if they are able to use a
time machine, go to one of the three time periods and explore.

2020-02-03
-game where you shoot cans by throwing cans that you have knocked
down. basically shooting enemies with enemies. as different cans
attack you in different ways, they're the same as weapons for
you to use.

2020-02-02
-guitar simulator for keyboard where you use the letters part (with
qwerty or whatever) for the strumming and the numpad for the chords.
though you could probably swap the two. maybe play songs by doing
the right chords? idk.
-game where you play as a key on a rgb keyboard. press a button to
change your hue. you have to keep up with the different patterns
the other rgb lights do.
-game where you work together with a ai. the ai plays as the person
who does the platforming, and you do the level design. the ai isn't
the greatest, so you have to help it sometimes. though you could
flip it and have the ai be really good, giving the challenge of
having to defeat the ai. of course, making it so it's possible to
complete the level at all.

2020-02-01
-(probably 3d) game where you design a ninja star. ninja stars will have 
multiple stats that the shape of the star will affect. maybe you can make 
multiple ninja stars, collect new metals, collect new tools and discover 
new throwiing techniques.
-platformer game where things move to the beat. background music. maybe
you can mess around with the music? add effects? idk
-throw/put stuff in a black hole to close it. (no gameplay idea sorry)

2020-01-31
-fast-paced point-and-click game where it generates a random world. you
are a pizza delivery man and you have 2 minutes to deliver as many pizzas
as you can.
^edit 2020-02-02: would probably be better as a 3d game.
-you know those bags where the bag itself is attached with a zipper?
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GMpVX__0QQ) well the goal of the game
is to assemble/zip things up like that. kinda weird to explain, but
imagine zipping two long fabric things together, which makes a piece to
zip together with another thing and soon you get a dog. idk
-game where you have to make a car by buying parts (parts are randomly
picked, you don't see all the parts). but the catch is you have 21
dollars. maybe have a ragdoll character when the car drives. like that
game Turbo Dismount.

-2d side scroller where you play as a tall creature. the creature has legs
on its head. it walks by flipping. think of it like someone doing a
handstand, and then going back to the feet. that's how the creature walks.
maybe the game could be a cool puzzle platformer? not sure.
-game where people ask you for advice. they'll say a problem they have and
you give them an answer. as you play the game, you meet more and more
people. from random strangers to leaders of countries. and as you give
advice, you can see how your advice affected people and the world. since
this would be a word heavy game maybe use ai like gpt-2 or something.
-game where you draw graphics which makes levels. at the start of the game
you need to draw a pencil to start drawing (idk). then you draw the ground
tiles, the player, and as you draw all these gameplay graphics the game
will generate levels based on your graphics. your run's graphics will be
made all by you, with the levels made indirectly by you.

-do calculations on a calculator on your jump ad as fast as you can. 
with timer.
-3d game where you assemble furniture without screws, you have to 
balance it.
-fps where you shoot plugs into sockets instead of shooting bullets. you
have to make sure your shooting into the right socket, so canadians or
european. but there's also universal.

-relaxing game where each run generates random new elements, with random
reactions. your goal is to label and document elements and reactions.
perferably not just checking boxes of what the reaction does, more like
you actually have to write/type it down. perhaps a system can detect if
you're describing the reactions and if you do describe them correctly.
-program that remaps your keyboard letters to different buttons everyday.
making it a game to use your computer for the day, having to figure out
what button is what letter. there could be a leaderboard of a streak of
how long they've been playing the game, each day figuring out what keys
are what.
-game (probably on a site) that gives you points whenever you connect
to a new wifi network. basically a boring pokemon go but connecting to
wifi instead of catching cool and cute monsters.

-remember facade? that game where you can say whatever you want during
a couple going through issues? remake that game but use gpt-2. basically 
a game where you talk and have conversation using gpt-2.
-game where the objective is to make a virus for a fake operating
system. the game has (or uses) a programming language. mess with the OS
and look for vulnerabilities.
-any basic game (not the focus of the idea) that has an api to allow
making custom achievements. people can post achievements online, and
soon, the game becomes the game with the most achievements ever.

-top down car game where you have to hit your opponents back of the car
-platformer game where you start at the bottom, lava rises and you have
to climb up the perlin-noise-generated levels until you die.
-3d game where you control a cube by controlling it's rotation/torque.
-2d platformer game where the character's hoodie string can extend. the
string extends towards your mouse cursor. so if you move your cursor
around a circle, the string will wrap around the circle.
-shootemup game where your bullets bounce up and down. so if you shoot,
the bullet goes to the top of the screen, bounces down, hits the bottom
of the screen and bounces up and so forth. so you have to shoot but also
dodge your own bullets.

-real time board game. have timer that ticks every second.
players will make moves to the timer, of course allowing the
option to wait.
-platformer or fps game where you can build up downward velocity.
this is like if you were programming gravity but never resetted it
so you keep just building velocity. basically a winded up ground 
pound.
-based off of that driver game and clicked playing a pico-8 game
"only one enemy", platformer game where you can switch souls to
another entity. basically switching the camera and controls to
any entity.

-platformer game where you're like the blue shell powerup
in mario (not mario kart) except you're always a shell.
-topdown (probably multiplayer) game where you have a sword
use the mouse to change the angle your player is facing. hit
the backside of the player with the sword.
-1d (line back and forth) multiplayer game where you can go left
and right, you can switch from rock paper or scissors. goal is to
touch the other player with the winning move. either controls are
keyboard or mouse but mouse can go too fast.

-top down game where you shoot enemys with blue bullets. 
bullets bounce from enemys and switch to red which damage you. 
so you have to shoot enemys but dodge your own bullets as well.
-top down shooting game where you can curb the bullet.
-spin around and use jet to get around in no gravity
^edit 2020-01-28: dunno how this is a game idea lol
-guy goes back and forth and goes up while dodging holes. like 
icy tower.
^edit 2020-01-28: basically imagine icy tower, but you always
move back and forth. the goal is to jump onto the higher platforms
while dodging holes.
