"dynamic" file listing

after like a day of messing around it's done.
first, check if 1.txt exists
if it does, woo, make a link with the link text
being the first line.
we know that 1.txt exists, so how about 2.txt?
oh, it doesn't? aww.
but the job here is done, the files are shown.
and you don't have to edit the index.html file
at all. it's still cool.
