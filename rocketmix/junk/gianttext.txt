I converted this text into a QR code and it might crash if you try to scan it.

Here's the QR code if you dare to scan it. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/210174253205684225/345029756888154134/unknown.png (not my fault if something happens, even the second qr code maker i used (the first one broke lol) even said might not work well with older devices. for newer ones it'll probably just lag a lot for like 30 seconds or so. idk anyways this is a long round bracket thingy idk.)

i tried to make this qr code look really big so i'm just gonna keep typing till it get's really big... maybe some spam might do it... 94012480923849231asdsa{%$#}%{#$ maybe a few unicode characters? ÑÜ§£◙ÑÜ§£◙ÑÜ§£◙ there we go maybe that did it, or not idk. actually i do know because the qr code automatically changes/updates when i type and from the looks of it it looks pretty big. i wonder what people might think when they see this qr and see how big it is lol. maybe i should copy and paste this text? sure. i tried to make this qr code look really big so i'm just gonna keep typing till it get's really big... maybe some spam might do it... 94012480923849231asdsa{%$#}%{#$ maybe a few unicode characters?
