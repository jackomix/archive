    <h1>Rocketmix Articles - Home</h1>
  </center>
  
  These are articles I created about stuff, inspired by how <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org">Owlman</a> has a library of articles, I decided I would make my own articles. Also I love the idea of websites with lots, lots and lots of content so this helps add on to that. Please enjoy your stay, grab a article and take a seat. Would you like coffee with that?
